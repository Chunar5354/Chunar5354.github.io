## 121.Best Time To Buy And Sell Stock

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

- My approach

Firstly I did a brout force method.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)-1):
            # Maximum of the rest subtract current number
            res = max(res, max(prices[i+1:])-prices[i])
        return res
```

But it runs very slowly, so I did a new one-pass method.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            # Make prices[i-1] always be the minimum number in prices[:i]
            if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
                res = max(res, prices[i]-prices[i-1])
                prices[i] = prices[i-1]
        return res
```


## 122.Best Time To Buy And Sell Stock 2

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

- My approach

Use the similar method like [Best Time To Buy And Sell Stock](https://github.com/Chunar5354/some_notes/blob/master/leetcode/problems/BestTimeToBuyAndSellStock.md)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if not prices:
            return 0
        res = 0
        crt_buy = prices[0]
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            # If current price is larger than crt_buy, current profit equals prices[i]-crt_buy, add it to res,
            # and then the last but price(crt_buy) can't be used twice, modify crt_buy to prices[i]
            if prices[i] > crt_buy:
                res += (prices[i]-crt_buy)
                crt_buy = prices[i]
            # If current price is smaller than brt_buy, means if we buy at current price can get larger profit, 
            # so modify crt_buy to prices[i]
            else:
                crt_buy = prices[i]
        return res
```


## 123.Best Time To Buy And Sell Stock 3  (Other's approach)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/)

- My approach

My own brute force method was time limit exceeded.

- Other's approach

There is a very smart dynamic program method.

The key point is `second_buy` deducts the `first_profit`, so `second_profit` equals the sum of two transactions.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        first_buy, second_buy, first_profit, second_profit = float('inf'), float('inf'), 0, 0
        for price in prices:
            first_buy = min(first_buy, price)
            first_profit = max(first_profit, price - first_buy)
            # Second_buy deducts first_profit, so the second contains informaiton both of first and second
            second_buy = min(second_buy, price - first_profit)
            second_profit = max(second_profit, price - second_buy)
        return second_profit
```


## 124.Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/)

- My approach

Use recursing method.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.res = float('-inf')
        def helper(node):
            if not node:
                return 0
            self.res = max(self.res, node.val)
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                return node.val
            # currentLeftsum: path sum of current left tree
            # currentRightsum: path sum of current right tree
            currentLeftSum = helper(node.left)
            currentRightSum = helper(node.right)
            # currentNodeSum: the maximum of left and right path sum plus current value, and return it to calculate higher level path sum
            currentNodeSum = max(currentLeftSum, currentRightSum, 0) + node.val
            # currentPathSum: if calculate stops at current node, current path sum will be (currentLeftSum + currentRightSum + node.val)
            currentPathSum = currentLeftSum + currentRightSum + node.val
            # Modify res to the maximum of these three values
            self.res = max(self.res, currentPathSum, currentNodeSum)
            return currentNodeSum
        helper(root)
        return self.res
```

- Explanation

For example, if the given binary tree is:
```
   -10
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

When goes to node `20`, the variables will be:
```
currentLeftsum: 15
currentRightsum: 7
currentNodeSum: 35, which stands for: 
   20
  /  
 15
 currentPathSum: 42, which stands for:
    20
   /  \
  15   7
```

And when goes to node `-10`, the variables will be:
```
currentLeftsum: 9
currentRightsum: 42
currentNodeSum: 25, which stands for: 
   -10
     \
     20
    /  \
   15   7
 currentPathSum: 41, which stands for:
   -10
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

So the maximum path sum is 42.


## 125.Valid Palindrome

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

- My approach

To avoid the characters which are not numbers or alphabets, translate the characters into ASCII code and check if they are in valid area.

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []
        for c in s:
            # Check ASCII code
            if 65 <= ord(c) <= 90 or 97 <= ord(c) <= 122 or 48 <= ord(c) <= 57:
                # Avoid cases
                stack.append(c.lower())
        return stack == stack[::-1]
```


## 126.Word Ladder 2  !!(Not finished)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/)

- My approach

Check every word if it has only one different position from the last word, until go to endWord.

```python
class Solution:
    def findLadders(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        if endWord not in wordList:
            return []
        res = []
        # Check if two words have only one different position
        def checkDiff(s1, s2):
            num = 0
            for i in range(len(s1)):
                if s1[i] != s2[i]:
                    num += 1
            return num
        
        def helper(wList, crt_res):
            if crt_res[-1] == endWord:
                res.append(crt_res)
                return
            if not wList:
                return
            for i in range(len(wList)):
                diffNum = checkDiff(wList[i], crt_res[-1])
                if diffNum == 1:
                    helper(wList[:i]+wList[i+1:], crt_res+[wList[i]])
                    
        helper(wordList, [beginWord])
        # Get the shorest answer in res
        minLength = float('inf')
        for r in res:
            minLength = min(len(r), minLength)
        return [r for r in res if len(r)==minLength]
```

This method need to check every word in every level, the time complex is `n!`. It's time exceeded.

But other's approaches are too complex, I will find another time to finish this problem.


## 127.Word Ladder  (Official solution)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/)

- My approach

My own recursing method was time limit exceeded again.

- Official approach

Consider this problem as a `graph`. Adjacent nodes are the two word which have only one different position.

The method to find adjacent nodes is create a dictionary which key contains a wildcard `*`, for example:
```python
{'h*t': ['hit', hot], 'ho*': ['hot', 'hog']}
```

So the value of dictionary is a list of adjacent nodes.

```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution(object):
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord, endWord, wordList):
        """
        :type beginWord: str
        :type endWord: str
        :type wordList: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        if endWord not in wordList or not endWord or not beginWord or not wordList:
            return 0

        # Since all words are of same length.
        L = len(beginWord)

        # Dictionary to hold combination of words that can be formed,
        # from any given word. By changing one letter at a time.
        all_combo_dict = defaultdict(list)
        for word in wordList:
            for i in range(L):
                # Key is the generic word
                # Value is a list of words which have the same intermediate generic word.
                all_combo_dict[word[:i] + "*" + word[i+1:]].append(word)

        # Queue for BFS
        queue = collections.deque([(beginWord, 1)])
        # Visited to make sure we don't repeat processing same word.
        visited = {beginWord: True}
        while queue:
            current_word, level = queue.popleft()      
            for i in range(L):
                # Intermediate words for current word
                intermediate_word = current_word[:i] + "*" + current_word[i+1:]

                # Next states are all the words which share the same intermediate state.
                for word in all_combo_dict[intermediate_word]:
                    # If at any point if we find what we are looking for
                    # i.e. the end word - we can return with the answer.
                    if word == endWord:
                        return level + 1
                    # Otherwise, add it to the BFS Queue. Also mark it visited
                    if word not in visited:
                        visited[word] = True
                        queue.append((word, level + 1))
                all_combo_dict[intermediate_word] = []
        return 0
```

### Knowledge

In official solution, it uses Python build-in method `collections` to create dictionary and queue.

Use this method can increase operating speed.


## 128.Longest Consecutive Sequence


[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

- My approach

Sort the array first then traverse.

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) <= 1:
            return len(nums)
        nums.sort()
        start = nums[0]
        res = 0
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            # Skip the same numbers
            if nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                continue
            # If the sequence is breaked, calculate the length and modify start number
            if nums[i] - nums[i-1] != 1:
                res = max(res, nums[i-1]-start+1)             
                start = nums[i]
        return max(res, nums[i]-start+1)
```


## 129.Sum Root To Leaf Numbers

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/)

- My approach

Use recursing method to traverse the tree in level order. And numbers in higher level have higher opsition.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def sumNumbers(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.res = 0
        def helper(node, rootVal):
            if not node:
                return
            # Root value has higher position
            crt_sum = rootVal*10+node.val
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                self.res += crt_sum
                return
            helper(node.left, crt_sum)
            helper(node.right, crt_sum)
        helper(root, 0)
        return self.res
```


## 130.Surrouned Regions

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/)

- My approach

The idea is starting from the four edges, when meet a 'O' in edge, go to find all the connected 'O'.

```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        if len(board) <= 2 or len(board[0]) <= 2:
            return board
        m = len(board)
        n = len(board[0])
        visited = []
        def helper(r, c):
            '''
            Find all the connected 'O', and save the positions into visited
            '''
            visited.append((r, c))
            if r-1 >= 0 and board[r-1][c] == 'O' and (r-1, c) not in visited:
                helper(r-1, c)
            if r+1 <= m-1 and board[r+1][c] == 'O' and (r+1, c) not in visited:
                helper(r+1, c)
            if c-1 >= 0 and board[r][c-1] == 'O' and (r, c-1) not in visited:
                helper(r, c-1)
            if c+1 <= n-1 and board[r][c+1] == 'O' and (r, c+1) not in visited:
                helper(r, c+1)
        # Traverse four edges
        for i in range(n):
            if board[0][i] == 'O':
                helper(0, i)
        for i in range(m):
            if board[i][n-1] == 'O':
                helper(i, n-1)
        for i in range(n):
            if board[m-1][i] == 'O':
                helper(m-1, i)
        for i in range(m):
            if board[i][0] == 'O':
                helper(i, 0)
        # Finally the 'O' which posiiton is in visited should not be changed
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if board[i][j] == 'O' and (i, j) not in visited:
                    board[i][j] = 'X'
```

But the code is lengthy and complex, inspired by other's approach, I improved this method.

```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        if len(board) <= 2 or len(board[0]) <= 2:
            return board
        m = len(board)
        n = len(board[0])
        # Create a list stands for four direction step
        step = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

        def helper(r, c):
            # Change the 'O' which doesn'e need to change to another letter 'I'
            if board[r][c] == 'O':
                board[r][c] = 'I'
                # Next position can be calculated by current position and the elements in step
                for x, y in step:
                    if 0 <= r+x <= m-1 and 0 <= c+y <= n-1:
                        helper(r+x, c+y)
        # Four edges
        for i in range(m):
            helper(i, 0)
            helper(i, n-1)
        for j in range(n):
            helper(0, j)
            helper(m-1, j)
        # Create a dictionary to change letters
        change = {'X': 'X', 'O': 'X', 'I': 'O'}
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                board[i][j] = change[board[i][j]]
```

The new code can run much more faster.


## 131.Palidrome Partitioning

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/)

- My approach

Create a dictionary to save the index of valid palindrome. Then use these palindromes filling the index of s from start to end.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        dicOfLetter = defaultdict(list)
        dicOfPali = defaultdict(list)
        # dicOfPali is a dictionary which key is index of s, and value is a list of indexs which can compose a palindrome with its key
        for i in range(len(s)):
            dicOfLetter[s[i]].append(i)
            for j in dicOfLetter[s[i]]:
                if s[j:i+1] == s[j:i+1][::-1]:
                    dicOfPali[min(i, j)].append(max(i, j))
        res = []
        def helper(idx, crt_res):
            if idx == len(s):
                res.append(crt_res)
                return
            # Every s[idx: end+1] now is a palindrome, and end+1 is the start of next palindrome, until the final element
            for end in dicOfPali[idx]:
                helper(end+1, crt_res+[s[idx:end+1]])
        helper(0, [])
        return res
```

  - Example

If the given `s` is "abcbaa", `dicOfPali` will be:
```python
{0: [0, 4], 1: [1, 3], 2: [2], 3: [3], 4: [4, 5], 5: [5]}
```

And there is a brief method from others.

- Other's approach

```python
class Solution:
    def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        ret = []
        def isPal(s):
            return s == s[::-1]
        
        def fn(s, l):
            if not s:
                ret.append(l)
                return
            # Traverse s, if current s[:i] is a palindrome, add s[:i] to result and go to traverse s[:i]
            for i in range(1, len(s)+1):
                if isPal(s[:i]):
                    fn(s[i:], l+[s[:i]])
        fn(s, [])
        return ret
```


## 132.Palidrome Partitioning 2  (Dynamic program)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning-ii/)

- My solution

My own solution failed. 

Then inspired by other's approach, found a dynamic method.

The method can be divide into two parts:

Firstly, use the method like [Palidrome Partitioning](https://github.com/Chunar5354/some_notes/blob/master/leetcode/problems/PalidromePartitioning.md) create a dictionary `dicOfPali` to save the palindrome indexs.

Secondly, create a list `dp` do dynamic program, that dp[i] stands for minimum cuts of `s[:i]`.

```python
class Solution:
    def minCut(self, s: str) -> int:
        dicOfLetter = defaultdict(list)
        dicOfPali = defaultdict(list)
        # dicOfPali is a dictionary which key is index of s, and value is a list of indexs which can compose a palindrome with its key
        for i in range(len(s)):
            dicOfLetter[s[i]].append(i)
            for j in dicOfLetter[s[i]]:
                if s[j:i+1] == s[j:i+1][::-1]:
                    dicOfPali[min(i, j)].append(max(i, j))

        dp = [0] + [float('inf')]*len(s)
        for i in range(len(dp)):
            for l in dicOfPali[i]:
                # s[i:l+1] is a palindrome
                # So the minimum cuts of s[:l+1] equals to minimum cuts of s[:i] plus 1, and take the minimus value
                dp[l+1] = min(dp[l+1], dp[i] + 1)
        return dp[-1] - 1
```

For the method to create `dicOfPali`, because every time need to check if s[j:i+1] is a palindrome, it may run slowly. 

There is a improved method.

- Other's approach

```python
class Solution:
    def minCut(self, s: str) -> int:
        dicOfPali = collections.defaultdict(list)
        def expand(l, r):
            # Find palindrome from middle to edge
            while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
                dicOfPali[l].append(r)
                l, r = l-1, r+1
        for i in range(len(s)):
            expand(i, i)
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            expand(i, i+1)
        
        # The following content is all the same
        dp = [0] + [float('inf') for _ in range(len(s))]
        for i in range(len(dp)):
            for l in dicOfPali[i]:
                dp[l+1] = min(dp[l+1], dp[i] + 1)
        return dp[-1] - 1
```

This method can run more faster.


## 133.Clone Graph  (Other's approach)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)

- My approach

Firstly I was confused by graph. Because when I create a new node, there is a problem that I should fill its `neighbors`, and the nodes 
is `neighbors` also have `neighbors` need to be filled, it seems like a unlimited cycle.

And the key point to solve this problem is that we can create the nodes firstly, then fill them step by step.

I wrote a very complex code:

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = []):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors
"""

class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not node:
            return None
        # Firstly save all the values in dic
        dic = {}
        stack = [node]
        while stack:
            n = stack.pop()
            n_list = []
            for nd in n.neighbors:
                n_list.append(nd.val)
                if nd.val not in dic.keys():
                    stack.append(nd)
            dic[n.val] = n_list
        visited = []
        # The save all the new nodes in dic_n
        dic_n = {}
        for i in dic.keys():
            dic_n[i] = Node(i, [])
        # Finally fill the neighbor of every node
        stack = [dic_n[1]]
        visited = []
        while stack:
            crt_n = stack.pop()
            if crt_n.val not in visited:
                visited.append(crt_n.val)
                for i in dic[crt_n.val]:
                    stack.append(dic_n[i])
                    crt_n.neighbors.append(dic_n[i])
        return dic_n[1]
```

But there is no need to do there complex operation. We can create new nodes at first as the method below.

- Other's approach

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = []):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors
"""

class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not node:
            return None    
        stack = [node]
        hm = {}
        # The key is given nodes, and the value is the copied new nodes
        hm[node] = Node(node.val)
        
        while stack:
            cur = stack.pop()      
            for nei in cur.neighbors:         
                if nei not in hm:
                    hm[nei] = Node(nei.val)    
                    stack.append(nei)             
                # append the copy of nei thru hm
                hm[cur].neighbors.append(hm[nei])
            
        return hm[node]
```


## 134.Gas Station

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)

- My approach

Firstly I used a brute force method.

```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        # If want to finished the circle, all the gas in 'gas' must be more than or equal to 'cost'
        if sum(gas) - sum(cost) < 0:
            return -1
        canStart = []
        diff = []
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            diff.append(gas[i]-cost[i])
            if gas[i] >= cost[i]:
                canStart.append(i)
        def helper(idx):
            crt_diff = diff[idx:] + diff[:idx]
            # crt_diff[i] stands for the gas from start to current station, if crt_diff[i] < 0, means can't go to next station
            for i in range(1, len(crt_diff)):
                crt_diff[i] += crt_diff[i-1]
                if crt_diff[i] < 0:
                    return False
            return True
        for start in canStart:
            res = helper(start)
            if res:
                return start
        return -1
```

But this method need to do traverse for every possible start,it runs slowly.

Inspired by others, there is a modified method.

```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        # If want to finished the circle, all the gas in 'gas' must be more than or equal to 'cost'
        if sum(gas) - sum(cost) < 0:
            return -1
        s = 0
        cur_tank = 0
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            cur_tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
            # cur_tank is the gas until current station, if cur_tank < 0, means the stations before current station can't be the start
            # So we modify the start station to the next station
            if cur_tank < 0:
                cur_tank = 0
                s = i + 1
        return s
```


## 135.Candy  (Official solution)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/)

- My approach

Traverse from left to right, if current rating value is larger than the last one, current child will get more candies than last 
child(c[i-1]+1). Then traverse from right to left, do the same operation.

```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        c = [1] * len(ratings)
        # From left to right
        for i in range(1, len(c)):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1] and c[i] <= c[i-1]:
                c[i] = c[i-1] +1
        # From right to left
        for i in range(len(c)-2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i+1] and c[i] <= c[i+1]:
                c[i] = c[i+1] + 1
        return sum(c)
```

In `official solution`, there is a `O(n)` method, but it's a little complex. For more information please view official solution.


## 136.Single Number

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

- My solution

FIrstly sort the array, and check if nums[i+1] = nums[i]

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        i = 0
        while i < len(nums)-1:
            # If current number is not single, skip two same numbers
            if nums[i+1] == nums[i]:
                i += 2
            else:
                return nums[i]
        return nums[-1]
```

- Official solution

This problem is very suitable to use `XOR` method.

Because `a⊕b⊕a=(a⊕a)⊕b=0⊕b=b`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        a = 0
        for i in nums:
            a ^= i
        return a
```


## 137.Single Number 2

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)

- My approach

Use the same mathod as [Single Number](https://github.com/Chunar5354/some_notes/blob/master/leetcode/problems/SingleNumber.md).

Check is nums[i+1] == nums[i], if yes, means current number is not the single number, skip these three numbers.

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        i = 0
        while i < len(nums) - 2:
            print(i)
            if nums[i] == nums[i+1]:
                i += 3
            else:
                return nums[i]
        return nums[-1]
```


## 138.Copy List With Random Pointer

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)

- My approach

The key point is how to find the random attribute of new node.

Use two dictionary, and linked the given node list and new node list with the index of node, here is `num`.

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
"""

class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        new_node = {None: None}
        node = {None: None}
        n = head
        num = 0
        # Both node and new_node have 'num', it stands for the index of every node
        while n:
            new_node[num] = Node(n.val)
            node[n] = num
            num += 1
            n = n.next
        new_node[num] = None
        i = 0
        while head:
            new_node[i].next = new_node[i+1]
            # Now we can find the index of current random node from 'node', and get new node from 'new_node' by index
            new_node[i].random = new_node[node[head.random]]
            i += 1
            head = head.next
        return new_node[0]
```

- Other's approach

There is a reursing method from other's. He use a memory `visited` to link the given node list and new node list.

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
"""

class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        visited = {}
        def helper(node):
            if not node:
                return None
            # The value of visited is new node, and both its next and random attribute have already been modified here
            if node in visited:
                return visited[node]
            # If current node has not been visited, create a new node and add it into visited
            crt_node = Node(node.val)
            visited[node] = crt_node
            
            crt_node.next = helper(node.next)
            crt_node.random = helper(node.random)
            return crt_node
        return helper(head)     
```


## 139.Word Break !lru_cache

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/)

- My approach

Use recursing method, check if there is a prefix of s in wordDict. If yes, modify s as `s[len(w):]` and go on until `s = ''`.

```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        self.res = False
        def helper(sub_s):
            # If self.res is True, means there is a valid answer. There is no need to do next operation
            if self.res:
                return
            if not sub_s:
                self.res = True
                return
            for w in wordDict:         
                if sub_s[:len(w)] == w:
                    # If there is a prefix of sub in wordDict, cut off all the duplicated 'w'
                    start = len(w)
                    while sub_s[start:start+len(w)] == w:
                        start += len(w)
                    helper(sub_s[start:])
        helper(s)
        return self.res
```

- Other's approach

The key point is also find the prefix. But instead cutting off the duplications, he use decorator `@lru_cache` as a memory.

```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        @lru_cache
        def helper(s):
            if not s:
                return True
            for w in wordDict:
                if s[:len(w)] == w:
                    if helper(s[len(w):]):
                        return True
            return False
        return helper(s)   
```

- Knowledge

When use a recursing code, to save he running time, we can use `@lru_cache`(least recently used) as amemory.


## 140.Word Break 2

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/)

- My approach

My own approaches are time limited exceeded.

- Other's approach

There is a clear recursing method with memory.

The `memo` is used to store the possible combination of current string with words in `wordDict`.

```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        wordDict = set(wordDict)
        memo = {}
        
        def search(string):
            if string in memo:
                return memo[string]
            else:
                paths = []
                
                # base case
                # we include this in here in the case a word
                # that exists in the dictionary can be further decomposed
                if string in wordDict:
                    paths.append(string)
                
                for i in range(len(string)):
                    # if a prefix exists, then see if remainder can be decomposed
                    if string[:i] in wordDict:
                        path = search(string[i:])
                        # if it can't be decomposed, then it will be empty
                        # for each decomposition, prepend the prefix
                        for p in path:
                            paths.append(string[:i] + " " + p)

                memo[string] = paths
                return memo[string]
        
        return search(s)
```
