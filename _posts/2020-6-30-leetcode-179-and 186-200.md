## 179.Largest Number  (Customize sorting)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/)

- My approach

The key point of this problem is how to specify the sorting rules. To make the result is the largest number, we must ensure that 
every combination of two numbers is the largest, it can be expressed as `str(nums[i] + nums[i-1]) > str(nums[i-1] + nums[i])`.

```python
class Solution:
    def largestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> str:
        # Firstly translate nums into string type
        nums = [str(n) for n in nums]
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            while i:
                if nums[i] + nums[i-1] > nums[i-1] + nums[i]:
                    nums[i], nums[i-1] = nums[i-1], nums[i] #swap
                else:
                    break
                i -= 1
                
        res = ''.join(nums)
        if res[0] == '0':
            return '0'
        return res
```

And to customize the sorting rule, we can use Python method `sorted(key=a_class)`.

By adding a parameter `key` to sorted funciton, we can customize the sorting rule as the value of key.

There are two ways to do this:

  - 1 Create a new class and overload the operator `<`(`__lt__`, less than).
  
  ```python
  class LargerNumKey(str):
      def __lt__(x, y):
          # We return the value as 'x+y > y+x', the result will be in descending order
          return x+y > y+x
        
  class Solution:
      def largestNumber(self, nums):
          largest_num = sorted(map(str, nums), key=LargerNumKey)
        
          largest_num = ''.join(largest_num)
          return '0' if largest_num[0] == '0' else largest_num
  ```
  
  - 2 Create a new function, and use Python build-in method cmp_to_key.
  
  ```python
  from functools import cmp_to_key
  class Solution:
      def largestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> str:
          # Atttention, to make the result is in descending order, the return value here is:
          # 'x + y < y + x returns 1', it's different from the method above
          cmp = lambda x, y: 1 if x + y < y + x else -1
          nums = list(map(str, nums))
          # Use cmp_to_key here
          nums.sort(key = cmp_to_key(cmp))
        
          res = int(''.join(nums))
          return str(res)
  ```

## 186.Repeated DNA Sequences

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/)

- My approach

To solve this problem, we can traverse the given string and create a memory to store each 10 length strings. When we meet a string that 
has already in memory, means it's repeated, add it into result.

```python
class Solution:
    def findRepeatedDnaSequences(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        res = set()
        mem = set()
        for i in range(len(s)-9):
            crt_s = s[i:i+10]
            if crt_s in mem:
                res.add(crt_s)
            else:
                mem.add(crt_s)
        return list(res)
```


## 188.Best Time To buy And Sell Stock4  (Attention)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/)

- My approach

This problem is the extension of [Best Time To Buy And Sell Stock 3](https://github.com/Chunar5354/some_notes/blob/master/leetcode/problems/BestTimeToBuyAndSellStock3.md).

Because this problem need to sell k times, we can create a k time cycle.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, k: int, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if k == 0 or len(prices) == 0:
            return 0
        # If k is larger than half of the length of prices, the problem becomes the question `Best time to buy and sell stock 2`
        if k > len(prices) // 2:
            return sum((prices[i+1] - prices[i]) for i in range(len(prices) - 1) if prices[i+1] > prices[i])
        # Create two list to store buy prices and profit
        price_buy = [float('inf')]*k
        profit = [0]*k
        for p in prices:
            for i in range(k):
                # Current buy price is the minimum of itself and (current price - last profit)
                if i == 0:
                    price_buy[i] = min(price_buy[i], p)
                else:
                    price_buy[i] = min(price_buy[i], p-profit[i-1])
                # Current profit is the maximum of itself and (current price - current buy price)
                profit[i] = max(profit[i], p-price_buy[i])
        # Because every time the prices before current position is included in current buy prices(price_buy[i])
        # the final whole profit is profit[-1]
        return profit[-1]
```


## 189.Rotate Array

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)

- My approach

We can reverse the array firstly, then pop the first element and append it at the end. And do the same operation for k times.

```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        nums.reverse()
        for i in range(k):
            to_append = nums.pop(0)
            nums.append(to_append)
        nums.reverse()
```

The official solution uses a smart method to swap the elements of k intervals. For more information, please see the official solution.


## 190.Reverse Bits  (Only bit operation)


[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

- My approach

Translate the integer to string, and reverse the string then translate ie back.

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        # When using bin(), there is a '0b' prefix of thhe result, we need to delete it
        s = str(bin(n))[2:]
        # Make up zeros to 32 length
        while len(s) < 32:
            s = '0' + s
        s = s[::-1]
        return int(s, 2)
```

There are some methods only use integer from official solution.

- Official approach

Create another integer and move bits from given number to the answer bit by bit.

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n):
        ret, power = 0, 31
        while n:
            # n&1 means only deal with the last bit every time
            ret += (n & 1) << power
            n = n >> 1
            power -= 1
        return ret
```

And there is a method to reverse a byte only using bit operations.

```python
def reverseByte(byte):
    return (byte * 0x0202020202 & 0x010884422010) % 1023
```

For more details please see official solution.


## 191.Number Of 1 Bits

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

- My approach

Use bit shift to check every bit.

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        while n:
            # Using and method to check only the last bit
            if n & 1 == 1:
                res += 1
            n = n >> 1
        return res
```

- Official approach

In binary numbers, `n and n-1` will clear all the bits after the last `1`. For example:

```
n  =  01100100
n-1 = 01100011
n and n-1 = 01100000
```

We can use this to clear the last `1` step by step until n becomes 0.

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        while n:
            n = n & n-1
            res += 1
        return res
```

Problem 192 to 197 are not Python questions, record them in another page.

## 198.House Robber

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)

- My approach

My idea is using dynamic program, every time set current position to the result of nums[:i].

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        if len(nums) <= 2:
            return max(nums)
        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            # nums[i] equals to the result of nums[:i]
            nums[i] = max(nums[i-1], nums[i] + max(nums[:i-1]))
        return nums[-1]
```

There is a more easier method by using two pointers.

- Other's approach

The idea is the same, `curr` means the result of nums[:i], and `prev` means the retult of nums[:i-2].

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        curr, prev = 0, 0
        for n in nums:
            tmp = curr
            curr = max(prev + n, curr)
            prev = tmp
        return curr
```


## 199.Binary Tree Right Side View

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/)

- My approach

Do a level order traversal, and add the last node into result.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def rightSideView(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        if not root:
            return []
        res = []
        stack = [root]
        # Do level order traversal
        while stack:
            # Add the most right node into result
            res.append(stack[-1].val)
            crt_stack = []
            for n in stack:
                if n.left:
                    crt_stack.append(n.left)
                if n.right:
                    crt_stack.append(n.right)
            stack = crt_stack
        return res
```


## 200.Number Of Islands

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

- My approach

Traverse the grid and when meet a '1', update all the connected '1' to 'X'. So every '1' stands for a new island.

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return 0
        island = 0
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        
        def helper(r, c):
            '''
            Update all the connected '1' to 'X'
            '''
            grid[r][c] = 'X'
            if r-1 >= 0 and grid[r-1][c] == '1':
                helper(r-1, c)
            if c-1 >= 0 and grid[r][c-1] == '1':
                helper(r, c-1)
            if r+1 <= m-1 and grid[r+1][c] == '1':
                helper(r+1, c)
            if c+1 <= n-1 and grid[r][c+1] == '1':
                helper(r, c+1)
                
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                # Because connected '1' are now 'X', every new '1' means there is a new island
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    island += 1
                    helper(i, j)
        return island
```
