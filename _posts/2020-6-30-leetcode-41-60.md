## 41.First Missing Positive

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/)

- My approach

Delete the negative integers and sort the array. Then we can easily find the missing number.
```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 1
        # Delete negative numbers
        l = [x for x in nums if x > 0]
        if len(l) == 0:
            return 1
        min_n = min(l)
        if min_n > 1:
            return 1
        else:
            # If current integer is in the list, go on and find the larger next number
            while min_n in l:
                min_n += 1
            return min_n
```

There is also a smart approach fron others.
```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        holes = {}
        # In holes, the keys stand for target positive numbers
        # Because we are dealing with positive numbers, so the length of nums must contain the target number we are finding
        for i in range(0, len(nums)+1):
            holes[i+1] = True
        if not nums:
            return 1
        # Set all the value of positive integers to 'False'
        for i in range(0, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > 0:
                holes[nums[i]] = False
        # Now in holes, the keys which value are False are the missing numbers,
        # we just need to find the smallest one
        for i in range(1, len(nums)+2):
            if holes[i]:
                return i
```

In this approach, the magic is because we are dealing with positive integers, the target number must be `smaller than the length 
of nums`.

And this approach is more common because it just use hashmap and traverse. All the languaues have these method.


## 42.Trapping Rain Water (Official solution)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

- My approach

My idea is `kill the max`. Traverse from left to right, when find a `height[i] < height[i-1]`, check if height[i-1] if the largest height.
If yes, then we reduce height[i-1] to the `second max` value, because how much water can a container store depends on the shorter edge. 
And then if height[i-1] is still larger than height[i], current volumn is `height[i-1]-height[i]`.

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in range(1, len(height)-1):
            if height[i] < height[i-1]:
                # Find max height of the rest right numbers
                m = max(height[i+1:])
                # If height[i-1] is larger than the max of the rest, reduce it into max
                if m < height[i-1]:
                    height[i-1] = m
                # If after reducing, height[i] is still smaller than height[i-1], calculate the volumn
                if height[i] < height[i-1]:
                    res += (height[i-1]-height[i])
                    # This is important, after calculating, we need to fill the blank(add height[i] as same as height[i-1])
                    height[i] = height[i-1]
                    
        return res
```

This approach calculate volumn one element by one element, and it needs to find a max. So it runs very slowly(beats 5%).

- Other's approach

This approach is the same as `offical approach 4`

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        ml, mr = 0, 0
        res = 0
        while l <= r:
            # Find the smaller one in l and r
            if height[l] <= height[r]:
                # ml is the left edge of the left notch
                if height[l] >= ml:
                    ml = height[l]
                # If height[l] is smaller than ml, current volumn is (ml - height[l])
                else:
                    res += ml - height[l]
                l += 1
            else:
                if height[r] >= mr:
                    mr = height[r]
                else:
                    res += mr - height[r]
                r -= 1
        return res
```


## 43.Multiply Strings  (Other's approach)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/multiply-strings/)

- My approach

The fastest way is using `str()` and `int()` method in python, but obviously it's not the intention.

My idea is converting str into int one digit by one.
```python
class Solution:
    def multiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        n1 = n2 = 0
        res = ''
        # Convert string into integer
        for i in range(len(num1)):
            n1 += (int(num1[len(num1)-i-1])*(10**i))
        for i in range(len(num2)):
            n2 += (int(num2[len(num2)-i-1])*(10**i))
        mul = n1 * n2
        # Convert integer into string
        while mul >= 10:
            mul, r = divmod(mul, 10)
            res = str(r) + res
        return str(mul)+res
```

But that's also a 'directly convert' method.

- Other's approach

Multiply digit by digit, and add in all.
```python
class Solution:
    def multiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        n, m = len(num1), len(num2)
        result = [0] * (n + m)
        for i, c1 in enumerate(num1[::-1]):
            carry = 0
            # After this 'for', result stores num1's current digit * num2, in descending order
            for j, c2 in enumerate(num2[::-1]):
                current = int(c1) * int(c2) + carry + result[i+j]
                carry, result[i+j] = divmod(current, 10)
            result[i+m] = carry

        return ''.join(map(str, result[::-1])).lstrip('0') or '0'
```

The magic is using carry and different position in result.


## 44.Wild card Match  (A good method)


[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/wildcard-matching/)

- My approach

This is also a problem like `regular expression`. And there is a similar problem before: [Regular Expression Matching](https://github.com/Chunar5354/some_notes/blob/master/leetcode/problems/RegularExpressionMatching.md)

Firstly I use a method like force solution, it needs to judge many situations, and I failed.

And inspired by other's approach, I find a solution. Th main idea is set '*' `matches empty '' firstly by default`.
```python
class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
        ls = len(s)
        lp = len(p)
        si, pi = 0, 0
        last_star = -1
        s_match = -1
        while si < ls:
            if pi < lp and (p[pi] == s[si] or p[pi] == '?'):
                si += 1
                pi += 1
            # If p[pi] == '*', record index of '*' and index of current matched s: '
            # In this case, we default '*' matches empty string ''
            elif pi < lp and p[pi] == '*':
                last_star = pi
                s_match = si
                pi += 1
            # If there is a '*' before, restart the matching as si=s_match, pi=last_star
            # In this case, we set this '*' matches one more element(s_match+1) than the last string
            elif last_star != -1:
                si = s_match + 1
                pi = last_star + 1
                s_match += 1
            # Else means p[pi] is not '?' or '*' and there is no '*' before
            else:
                return False
        # There may be some elements remained in p, they must be all '*', or return False
        if pi < lp:
            for sub_p in p[pi:]:
                if sub_p != '*':
                    return False
        return True
```


## 45.Jump Game 2

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/)

- My approach

The key of this problem is find the max of `value + index`, it means the longest step to jump.
```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return 0
        i = 0
        final = len(nums) - 1
        jump_times = 0
        while i < len(nums) - 1:
            jump_times += 1
            # Calculate the distance from current element to the last element
            dis = final - i
            # If the distance is smaller than current number, means we can jump to the last element from current element
            if dis <= nums[i]:
                return jump_times
            else:
                step_d = {}
                # If distance is larger than current number, 
                # we search in the next 'n' elements in nums, which 'n' equals to current number
                # (because from current number, we can jump to 'n' steps),
                # if there is a element which value is larger than distance, means we can jump to the final from this number
                sub_n = nums[i+1: i+nums[i]+1]
                for j in range(len(sub_n)):
                    if sub_n[j] >= dis:
                        return jump_times + 1
                    else:
                        step_d[sub_n[j]+j] = j
                # If there is no element larger than distance, we find the number which the value of (sub_n[j]+j) is the largest,
                # and it is the next jump-to element, then go on
                next_step = step_d[max(step_d.keys())]
                i += next_step+1
        return jump_times + 1
```

And there is a more concise way by others
```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        tmp = [i + v for i, v in enumerate(nums)]
        left = right = res = 0
        while right < len(nums)-1:
            # Fucking 'max(tmp[left:right+1])'
            left, right, res = right, max(tmp[left:right+1]), res + 1
        return res
```


## 46.Permutations

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)

- My approach

A very problem by using rescuring method.

```python
class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        
        def traceback(sub_res, l):
            if len(l) == 0:
                res.append(sub_res)
            else:
                # In each layer of program, select one number add at the end of sub_res
                for i in range(len(l)):
                    traceback(sub_res+[l[i]], l[:i]+l[i+1:])
        traceback([], nums)
        return res
```

And there is also a method without recursing.
```python
class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        ans = [[]]        
        
        # Insert every number from nums into ans
        for n in nums:
            new_ans = []
            for l in ans:
                # For each l, insert current number in every position of l
                for i in range(len(l)+1):
                    new_ans.append(l[:i] + [n] + l[i:])
            ans = new_ans
        
        return ans
```


## 47.Permutation 2

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations-ii/)

- My approach

This problem is same as [Permutation](https://github.com/Chunar5354/some_notes/blob/master/leetcode/problems/Permutations.md), but add duplications. We can also use recursing.
```python
class Solution:
    def permuteUnique(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        def traceback(sub_res, l):
            if len(l) == 0:
                if sub_res not in res:
                    res.append(sub_res)
            else:
                for i in range(len(l)):
                    traceback(sub_res+[l[i]], l[:i]+l[i+1:])
        traceback([], nums)
        return res
```

But this method runs very slowly(beats 7%).

- Other's approach

Use three 'for' cycles, without recursing.
```python
class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        ans = [[]]        
        
        # Insert every number from nums into ans
        for n in nums:
            new_ans = []
            for l in ans:
                # For each l, insert current number in every position of l
                for i in range(len(l)+1):
                    new_ans.append(l[:i] + [n] + l[i:])
                    # If meet a repeated number, avoid it
                    if i < len(l) and n == l[i]:
                        break
            ans = new_ans
        
        return ans
```


## 48.Rotate Image

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/)

- My approach

The magic is finding out the coordinate relationsip of the four elements which are perpendicular to each othe
(找到互相垂直的四个元素的坐标关系).
```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        # Here l-1 because in the first line, we just need to traverse the elements from line[0] to line[len(matrix)-2]
        # (because the last element in the first line will be replaced by the first element)
        l = len(matrix)-1
        s = 0
        for i in range(l):
            # To avoid repeating, for every next line, reduce two edge elements
            for j in range(s, l-s):
                # The four element perpendicular to each other have a coordinate relationsip like this:
                matrix[j][l-i], matrix[l-i][l-j], matrix[l-j][i], matrix[i][j] = matrix[i][j], matrix[j][l-i], matrix[l-i][l-j], matrix[l-j][i]
            s += 1
            # If we get into the center element, return
            if l-s - s <= 0:
                return
```


## 49.Group Anagrams

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)h

- My approach

Unexpectedlly my diea is the same as official approach.
```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        # Set a dictionary which key: value is as 
        # sorted_str: list_str
        d = {}
        res = []
        
        for s in strs:
            # Transform str into list, then sort it, and transform the sorted list into a new str, as the key
            # (beceuse list can't be the key od a dictionary), and the value of 'd' is str list.
            list_s = list(s)
            list_s.sort()
            sorted_s = ''.join(list_s)
            if sorted_s not in d.keys():
                d[sorted_s] = [s]
            else:
                d[sorted_s].append(s)
        for k in d.keys():
            res.append(d[k])
        return res
```

And the offical approach uses `tuple` as the key oof dictionary.
```python
import collections

class Solution(object):
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
        # Set the default type of the value to list
        ans = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for s in strs:
            ans[tuple(sorted(s))].append(s)
        return ans.values()
```

And there is also a method by using `unicode`.
```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(strs):
        ans = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for s in strs:
            # Set a 26 length list which default value is 0
            count = [0] * 26
            for c in s:
                # For each character, add 1 to the corresponding position
                count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
            ans[tuple(count)].append(s)
        return ans.values()
```


## 50.Pow(x, n)


[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)

- My approach

We can directly use `**` method to calculate the power.
```python
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        return round(x**n, 5)
```

And we can use a recursing-binary-search method.
```python
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        if n < 0:
            x = 1 / x
            n = -n
        # A recursing function
        def traceback(ans, t):
            quo = t // 2
            if quo >= 1:
                diff = t - quo * 2
                # The answer is (ans^2)^quo--(diff=0)
                # or ans*((ans^2)^quo)--(diff=1)
                if diff == 0:
                    return traceback(ans*ans, quo)
                else:
                    return ans*traceback(ans*ans, quo)
            else:
                return ans
        return traceback(x, n)
```


## 51.N-Queens

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/)

- My solution

A little difficult problem, I have learnt it in class. Using recursing method to try every position.

Firstly, my code is like this, but it `failed`.
```python
class Solution:
    def solveNQueens(self, n: int) -> List[List[str]]:
        res_list = []
        res = []
        
        # Because every time we insert 'Q' into a new row, we just need to check columns and diagonal.
        def judge(r, c, p):
            for pos in p:
                if pos[1] == c or abs(pos[0]-r) == abs(pos[1]-c):
                    return False
            return True
        
        def traceback(l, position):
            if l == n:
                # Problem here
                return res_list.append(res)

            for i in range(n):
                for p in position:
                    current_line = ['.']*n
                    # If current position is available, insert a 'Q' at this position, and go to next row
                    if judge(l, i, position):
                        current_line[i] = 'Q'
                        current_line = ''.join(current_line)
                        res.append(current_line)
                        # Problem here
                        return traceback(l+1, position+[[l, i]])
        
        traceback(0, [[-1, -1]])
        return res_list
```

This code has a problem. In the code aboce where commentd by `Problem here`.

By using `return` or not, this code will return different result. There may be short of elements or extra elements in 
he final result.

Then I search for others' approach, and get an idea that `replace the part of making result strings`. The code like this:
```python
class Solution:
    def solveNQueens(self, n: int) -> List[List[str]]:
        res_list = []
        
        def judge(r, c, p):
            for pos in p:
                if pos[1] == c or abs(pos[0]-r) == abs(pos[1]-c):
                    return False
            return True
        
        def traceback(l, position):
            # Now we make result string here
            if l == n:
                res = []
                for p in position:
                    current_line = ['.']*n
                    current_line[p[1]] = 'Q'
                    current_line = ''.join(current_line)
                    res.append(current_line)
                return res_list.append(res)

            # And we just deal with position here
            for i in range(n):
                if judge(l, i, position):
                    traceback(l+1, position+[[l, i]])
        
        traceback(0, [])
        return res_list
```

This time it works.

And then we can simplify `position` to a one-bit array.
```python
class Solution:
    def solveNQueens(self, n: int) -> List[List[str]]:
        res = []
        def traceback(l, position):
            if l == n:
                current_res = []
                for i in position:
                    base_list = ['.']*n
                    base_list[i] = 'Q'
                    current_res.append(''.join(base_list))
                res.append(current_res)
                return
            for i in range(n):
                if judge(l, i, position):
                    # Now position is an one-bit array, its index stands for row
                    traceback(l+1, position+[i])
                    
        def judge(r, c, position):
            for pr, pc in enumerate(position):
                if pc == c or abs(pr-r) == abs(pc-c):
                    return False
            return True
        
        traceback(0, [])
        return res
```

- A smarter method

When doing the [N-Queens2](https://github.com/Chunar5354/some_notes/blob/master/leetcode/problems/NQueens2.md) problem, I find a smart method by judging with index of rows and columns. And it can be used 
in this problem.
```python
class Solution:
    def solveNQueens(self, n: int) -> List[List[str]]:
        res_list = []
        
        def traceback(res, rl, rr):
            l = len(res)
            if l == n:
                sub_res = []
                for r in res:
                    current_line = ['.']*n
                    current_line[r] = 'Q'
                    current_line = ''.join(current_line)
                    sub_res.append(current_line)
                return res_list.append(sub_res)

            for i in range(n):
                # res stands for column, the index of elements in res stands for row,
                # rl stands for left diagonal, rr stands for right diagonal
                if i not in res and l+i not in rl and l-i not in rr:
                    traceback(res+[i], rl+[l+i], rr+[l-i])
        
        traceback([], [], [])
        return res_list
```


## 52.N-Queens 2

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens-ii/)

- My approach

This problem is the same as [N-Queens](https://github.com/Chunar5354/some_notes/blob/master/leetcode/problems/NQueens.md), the difference is in this problem, we just need to return the count of available answers.

So we can use the same method, and add a number when find the right answer.
```python
class Solution:
    def totalNQueens(self, n: int) -> int:
        self.res = 0
        def traceback(l, position):
            if l == n:
                self.res += 1
                return
            for i in range(n):
                if judge(l, i, position):
                    traceback(l+1, position+[i])
        
        def judge(r, c, position):
            for pr, pc in enumerate(position):
                if pc == c or abs(pr-r) == abs(pc-c):
                    return False
            return True
        traceback(0, [])
        return self.res
```

Then when I looking at others' results, I find a smart method.

It doesn't define a extra function to do the judge, instead by judging with index of rows and columns.
```python
class Solution:
    def totalNQueens(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = [0]
        def dp(r, rollleft, rollright):
            i = len(r)
            if i == n:
                res[0] += 1
                return
            for j in range(n):
                # res stands for column, the index of elements in res stands for row,
                # rl stands for left diagonal, rr stands for right diagonal.
                # Because all the elements on the left digonal have the same value of (i + j),
                # and all the elements on the right digonal have the same value of (i - j).
                if j not in r and i + j not in rollleft and i - j not in rollright:
                    dp(r + [j], rollleft + [i + j], rollright + [i - j])
        dp([], [], [])
        return res[0]
```


## 53.Maximum Subarray  (Divide and conquer method)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

- My approach

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        current_sum = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # Add numbers from left to right
            current_sum += nums[i]
            if current_sum > 0:
                res = max(res, current_sum)
            # When current_sum < 0, means the sum of left part is negative,
            # and if go on adding, the left part will reduce the whole sum,
            # so we should abandon the left part by reset current_sum to 0
            else:
                current_sum = 0
        
        max_nums = max(nums)
        if max_nums <= 0:
            return max_nums
        return max(res, max_nums)
```

But I didn't find the approach of `divide and conquer` mentioned by the question.


## 54.Sprial Matirx

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/)

- My approach

Something like force approach. Divide the sprial into four directions: right, down, left, up.
```python
class Solution:
    def spiralOrder(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        m = len(matrix)
        if m == 0:
            return []
        n = len(matrix[0])
        end = n // 2
        l = 0
        res = []
        # When arrive half of rows, the sprial is over
        while l <= end:
            # right
            r = l - 1   # The start of right direction
            if r < 0:
                r = 0
            while r < n-l:
                res.append(matrix[l][r])
                r += 1
            # To avoid duplications, at end of every direction, we should judge if all the elements in matrix
            # have been in res
            if len(res) == m*n:
                return res
            # down
            d = l + 1   # The start of down direction
            while d < m-l:
                res.append(matrix[d][r-1])
                d += 1
            if len(res) == m*n:
                return res
            # left
            left = n - l - 2    # The start of left direction
            while left >= l:
                res.append(matrix[d-1][left])
                left -= 1
            if len(res) == m*n:
                return res
            # up
            u = m - l - 2    # The start of up direction
            while u > l+1:
                res.append(matrix[u][left+1])
                u -= 1
            if len(res) == m*n:
                return res
            l += 1
        return res
```

- Offical approach

In offical approach, there is a good idea of setting directions in list.
```python
class Solution(object):
    def spiralOrder(self, matrix):
        if not matrix: return []
        R, C = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        seen = [[False] * C for _ in matrix]
        ans = []
        # For rows, firstly on the right direction, the index of row doesn't change
        # secondly on the down direction, the index of row will plus 1 every time
        # thirdly on the left direction, the index of row doesn't change
        # finally on the up direction, the index of row will reduce 1 every time
        dr = [0, 1, 0, -1]
        # And for columns there is also a rule
        dc = [1, 0, -1, 0]
        r = c = di = 0
        for _ in range(R * C):
            ans.append(matrix[r][c])
            seen[r][c] = True
            cr, cc = r + dr[di], c + dc[di]
            if 0 <= cr < R and 0 <= cc < C and not seen[cr][cc]:
                r, c = cr, cc
            else:
                # If conditions are not met, change next direction
                di = (di + 1) % 4
                r, c = r + dr[di], c + dc[di]
        return ans
```

And there is also an approach using recursing method, but it's a little complex. If you want to see the details, please go to the 
official page.


## 55.Jump Game (Official solution)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)

- My approach

My idea is finding every 0 in nums, and check if the elements before 0 can jump over it. 
If can't jump over 0, means can't jump to the end.

```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        if 0 not in nums or len(nums) <= 1:
            return True
        while 0 in nums:
            # Find current position of 0
            zero_position = nums.index(0)
            # If 0 is the last element, means can jum to 0
            if zero_position == len(nums) - 1:
                return True
            can_jump = False
            # Traverse elements before 0, if the value is larger than difference between two indexs,
            # means it can jump over this 0
            # Then set current 0 to -1, and go on finding next 0
            for i in range(zero_position):
                # Avoid -1 
                if nums[i] < 0:
                    continue
                if nums[i] > zero_position - i:
                    can_jump = True
                    break
            if not can_jump:
                return False
            nums[zero_position] = -1
        return True
```

- Official approach

There is a smart idea by official solution. Traverse from right to left, and reset the target element.
```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        l = len(nums)
        target = l - 1
        for i in range(l):
            current = l - i - 1
            # If can jump from current element to target, then current element can be the new target
            if nums[current] + current >= target:
                target = current
        # Finally check if the first element can be the target(can jump from first to last)
        return target == 0
```

For more details can read the official solution.


## 56.Merge Intervals

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

- My approach

My idea is as same as the second official solution.

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if len(intervals) == 0:
            return []
        # Firstly sort the list
        intervals.sort()
        res = [intervals[0]]
        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            # Check the last list in res and current list in intervals
            # If the end of res[-1] is larger than the start os intervals[i], means these two lists should be merged
            if res[-1][-1] >= intervals[i][0]:
                # The start of new list is the minimum of two lists, 
                # and the end of new list is the maximumm of two lists
                res[-1] = [min(res[-1][0], intervals[i][0]), max(res[-1][-1], intervals[i][-1])]
            # If the end of res[-1] is smaller than the start os intervals[i], just append intervals[i] to res
            else:
                res.append(intervals[i])
        return res
```

### Conclusion

- Two-dimensional in Python can be sorted by `sort()`


## 57.Insert Interval

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/)

- My approach

This problem is an extension of [Merge Intervals](https://github.com/Chunar5354/some_notes/blob/master/leetcode/problems/MergeIntervals.md).
We can use the same method.
```python
class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if len(intervals) == 0:
            return [newInterval]
        # Firstly add newInterval into intervals
        intervals.append(newInterval)
        intervals.sort()
        res = [intervals[0]]
        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if res[-1][1] >= intervals[i][0]:
                res[-1][1] = max(res[-1][1], intervals[i][1])
            else:
                res.append(intervals[i])
        return res
```


## 58.Length Of Last Word

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/)

- My approach

An easy problem, jus traverse from right to left, until finding a whitespace.
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        if not s:
            return 0
        l = len(s)
        c = l - 1
        # Aviod whitespace at the end of s
        while s[c] == ' ' and c > 0:
            c -= 1
        for i in range(c+1):
            n = c - i
            if s[n] == ' ':
                return i
        return (c+1)
```

We can also use Python built-in method `spilt` to transform s to a list.
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        l = s.split(" ")
        for i in range(len(l)):
            n = len(l) - i - 1
            if l[n]:
                return (len(l[n]))
        return 0
```


## 59.Sprial Matrix 2

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-ii/)

- My approach

We can use the same method as [Sprial Matirx](https://github.com/Chunar5354/some_notes/blob/master/leetcode/problems/SprialMatirx.md).
```python
class Solution:
    def generateMatrix(self, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        visited = []
        res = []
        for i in range(n):
            res.append([0]*n)
        dr = [0, 1, 0, -1]
        dc = [1, 0, -1, 0]
        r = c = index = 0
        for i in range(1, n**2+1):
            res[r][c] = i
            visited.append((r, c))
            # Set two intermediate variables then judge them
            cr = r + dr[index]
            cc = c + dc[index]
            # If intermediate variables are available, ser (r, c) = (cr, cc)
            if (cr, cc) not in visited and 0 <= cc < n and 0 <= cr < n:
                r = cr
                c = cc
            # If they are not available, change the direction
            else:
                index = (index + 1) % 4
                r += dr[index]
                c += dc[index]
        return res
```


## 60.Permutation Sequence  (The using of (n-1)!)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/)

- My approach

I wanted to calcuate the total permutation of n numbers and find the kth element, but it's time exceeded.

By referencing other's approach, I get a method to find the regulation of permutation, about`(n-1)!`.
```python
class Solution:
    def getPermutation(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        # Set all str(number) into a list
        arr = [str(i + 1) for i in range(n)]
        res = []
        # Calculate factorial of n
        fac = 1
