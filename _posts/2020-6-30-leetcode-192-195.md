## 192.Word Frequency

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-frequency/)

- My approach

This is a problem of `bash`. I didn't know much about bash, this is a start of learning.

Here is one of the answers, I will split the code and show the feature of every part.

```
xargs -n1 < words.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -r | awk '{print $2" "$1}'
```

For example, here is a file named `words.txt`:

```
the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is
```

Firstly, `xargs` can print the context of file `words.txt`.

```
$ xargs < words.txt
the day is sunny the the the sunny is is
```

And `-n1` can format the output as each line one word.

```
$ xargs -n1 < words.txt
the
day
is
sunny
the
the
the
sunny
is
is
```

Then `sort` can sort the output by alphabetical order.

```
$ xargs -n1 < words.txt | sort
day
is
is
is
sunny
sunny
the
the
the
the
```

And `uniq` will make every word appear once, `-c` will add the count of the word at the front of the word.

```
$ xargs -n1 < words.txt | sort | uniq -c
      1 day
      3 is
      2 sunny
      4 the
```

The second `sort` has a parameter `-r`, it will make the output by reverse order.

```
$ xargs -n1 < words.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -r
      4 the
      3 is
      2 sunny
      1 day
```

Finally, `awk` will format every line. Here `'{print $2" "$1}'` means print the second element firstly, then add a whitespace between 
the two elements, finally print the first element.

```
$ xargs -n1 < words.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -r | awk '{print $2" "$1}'
the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1
```

And this is the answer of this problem.


## 193.Valid Phone Numbers


[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-phone-numbers/)

- My approach

To search valid content from files, we can use `grep`(global regular expression print) command.

Here we use `perl regular expression`, which is `-P` in grep.

```
grep '^(\d{3}-|\(\d{3}\) )\d{3}-\d{4}$' file.txt
```

`^` means start, `$` means the end.

`\d{3}` means three digitals.

`|` means or.


## 194.Transpose File

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/transpose-file/)

- My approach

We can use `awk` command and write some codes in it.

```shell
awk '{ for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) {
            if (NR==1) s[i]=$i; 
            else s[i] = s[i] " " $i;
        }
     } END { for (i in s) print s[i] }' file.txt
```

Here `NF` is the number of lines, and `NR` is the index of every line, but start with 0.

For more details about NF and NR, please see [here](https://blog.csdn.net/a1414345/article/details/79071951).


## 195.Tenth Line

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/tenth-line/)

- My approach

This problem can besolved by `awk` command.

```
awk 'NR == 10' file.txt
```

And we can also solve it by using `sed` in `cat`.

```
cat file.txt | sed -n 10p
```

`sed` is a command that can deal with texts.
