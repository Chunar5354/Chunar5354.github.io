## 61.Rotate List  (The none-list method)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/)

- My approach

My idea is store the value of every node in a list, and rotate the list, finally transform the list into a linked list.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        if not head:
            return None
        n = head
        # Save values into list
        nodes = []
        while n:
            nodes.append(n.val)
            n = n.next
        # For every multiple of len(nodes), the list rotate to the initial order,so we use a '%' to calculate the remainder
        num = k % len(nodes)
        # Rotate the list
        for i in range(num):
            crt_node = nodes.pop(-1)
            nodes.insert(0, crt_node)
        # Transform list into linked list
        new_head = nd = ListNode(nodes[0])
        for j in range(1, len(nodes)):
            nd.next = ListNode(nodes[j])
            nd = nd.next
        return new_head
```

And there is a method without using list.
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        
        length = 0
        curr = head
        # Calculate length of linked list
        while curr:
            length += 1
            curr = curr.next
        # For every multiple of len(nodes), the list rotate to the initial order,so we use a '%' to calculate the remainder
        k %= length
        if k == 0:
            return head
        
        index = 0
        curr = head
        # After rotate k times, the new head is the (length-k+1)th node
        while index < length - k:
            curr = curr.next
            index += 1
        new_head = curr
        # And then add the nodes before new_head at end of new linked list
        while curr.next != new_head:
            if curr.next is None:
                curr.next = head
            curr = curr.next
        
        curr.next = None
        return new_head
```


## 62.Unique Paths

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

- My solution

My idea is using recursing method, but it's time ecdeeded.

Then I found an other's method using a m*n matrix, very smart.

- Other's solution

The magic is the number of ways of current point equals to the ways of the sum its `left and up` point.

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        # Set a m*n matrix
        mat =[[0 for i in range(m)] for j in range(n)]
        # The up and left edge points only have one way directed to them
        for j in range(m):
            mat[0][j]=1
        for i in range(n):
            mat[i][0]=1
        # For every other point, ways to them equals to sum of ways of their left and up points
        for i in range(1,n):
            for j in range(1,m):
                mat[i][j]=mat[i][j-1]+mat[i-1][j]
        # And finally, the number of ways to the end is in mat[m-1][n-1]
        return mat[n-1][m-1]
```


## 63.Unique Paths 2


[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/)

- My approach

Use the same method as [Unique Paths](https://github.com/Chunar5354/some_notes/blob/master/leetcode/problems/UniquePaths.md), and set the number of obstacles to 0.
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m = len(obstacleGrid)
        n = len(obstacleGrid[0])
        # If the start cell or final cell is an obstacle, there is no way
        if obstacleGrid[m-1][n-1] == 1 or obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1:
            return 0
        # Set first column and row values to -1(because 1 stands for obstacles, we use negative number to count the ways), 
        # and when meet an obstacle, the cells after it will be set to 0,
        # because in the edge cells, if there is an obstacle before current cell, means this cell can't be arrivaled
        for k in range(m):
            if obstacleGrid[k][0] == 1:
                break
            obstacleGrid[k][0] = -1
        for l in range(n):
            if obstacleGrid[0][l] == 1:
                break
            obstacleGrid[0][l] = -1
        # For each cell, the ways equals to the sum of ways of left and up cell, and if left or cell is an obstacle, its way is 0
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1:
                    continue
                up = obstacleGrid[i-1][j]
                left = obstacleGrid[i][j-1]
                if up == 1:
                    up = 0
                if left == 1:
                    left = 0
                obstacleGrid[i][j] = left + up
        # Finally the answer is in obstacleGrid[m-1][n-1], but negative.
        return -obstacleGrid[m-1][n-1]
```


## 64.Minimun Path

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)

- My approach

This problem is also like [Unique Paths](https://github.com/Chunar5354/some_notes/blob/master/leetcode/problems/UniquePaths.md).

And the magic is minimun length of current cell equals to the minimum of left and up cell plus current cell.
```python
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        # For the first column, the length of this cell is the sum of all the cells above
        for r in range(1, m):
            grid[r][0] = grid[r-1][0] + grid[r][0]
        # For the first row, the length of this cell is the sum of all the cells left
        for c in range(1, n):
            grid[0][c] = grid[0][c-1] + grid[0][c]
        # For every cell, the minimun length equals to the minimum of left and up cell plus current cell
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                grid[i][j] = min(grid[i-1][j], grid[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
        return grid[m-1][n-1]
```


## 65.Valid Number

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-number/)

- My approach

We can use python built-in method `float` directly.
```python
class Solution:
    def isNumber(self, s: str) -> bool:
        try:
            float(s)
            return True
        except:
            return False
```

Or consider every condition.
```python
class Solution:
    def isNumber(self, s: str) -> bool:
        n = set('0123456789')
        # If there is no number in s, it's not valid
        if not set(s) & n:
            return False
        valid = '+-0123456789e.'
        start = 0
        end = len(s) - 1
        # Delete whitespaces at the edge
        while start < len(s) and s[start] == ' ':
            start += 1
        while end > 0 and s[end] == ' ':
            end -= 1
        s = s[start: end+1]
        # Unvalid characters
        for i in s:
            if i not in valid:
                return False
        # About 'e'
        if 'e' in s:
            e = s.index('e')
            # Left of 'e' or right of 'e' must be a number
            # And there can't be a '.' right of 'e'
            # And there can't be more than one 'e'
            if not set(s[:e]) & n or not set(s[e:]) & n or '.' in s[e+1:] or 'e' in s[e+1:]:
                return False
        # About '.', there can only be one '.'
        if s.count('.') > 1:
            return False
        # About '+-'
        # '+' and '-' can only be at the beginning or next 'e'
        # And except the first element, there can be at most 2 '+' or '-'
        if s[1:].count('+') > 1 or s[1:].count('-') > 1:
            return False
        if '+' in s[1:]:
            index = s[1:].index('+')
            if s[index] != 'e':
                return False
        if '-' in s[1:]:
            index = s[1:].index('-')
            if s[index] != 'e':
                return False
        return True
```


## 66.Plus One


[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/)

- My approach

The first approach is transform list into an integer, then plus one, and transform the integer back to a list.
```python
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        number = 0
        for i in range(len(digits)):
            n = len(digits) - i - 1
            number += digits[n] * 10 ** i
        number += 1
        res = []
        while number > 0:
            num = number % 10
            res = [num] + res
            number = number // 10
        return res
```

And the second approach is plus on the list itself.
```python
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Considering carry, firstly add a '0' at the start of list
        digits = [0] + digits
        for i in range(len(digits)):
            n = len(digits) - i - 1
            digits[n] += 1
            # If current sum equals to 10, it needs to do a carry
            if digits[n] == 10:
                digits[n] = 0
            else:
                break
        # Finally delete the '0' at beginning
        j = 0
        while digits[j] == 0:
            j += 1
            
        return digits[j:]
```


## 67. Add Binary

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary/)

- My approach

One idea is add two strings position by position.
```python
class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        # Considering carry, firstly add a '0' at the beginning of a and b
        a = '0' + a
        b = '0' + b
        carry = 0
        res = ''
        i = len(a)
        j = len(b)
        while i and j:
            # Plus with carry
            current_n = int(a[i-1]) + int(b[j-1]) + carry
            # If overflowed, current number should reduce 2, and set carry to 1
            if current_n > 1:
                current_n -= 2
                carry = 1
            else:
                carry = 0
            res = str(current_n) + res
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        # a and b may have different length
        while i:
            current_n = int(a[i-1]) + carry
            if current_n > 1:
                current_n -= 2
                carry = 1
            else:
                carry = 0
            res = str(current_n) + res
            i -= 1
        while j:
            current_n = int(b[j-1]) + carry
            if current_n > 1:
                current_n -= 2
                carry = 1
            else:
                carry = 0
            res = str(current_n) + res
            j -= 1
        # Finally there may be a '0' at the start of res
        if res[0] == '0':
            return res[1:]
        return res
```

And the second idea is transform a and b into integer, then plus them, and transform the answer into binary string.
```python
class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        if a == b == '0':
            return '0'
        m = len(a)
        n = len(b)
        numa = 0
        numb = 0
        # Transform a and b into integer
        for i in range(m):
            numa += int(a[m-i-1]) * 2**i
        for j in range(n):
            numb += int(b[n-j-1]) * 2**j
        sum_ab = numa + numb
        res = ''
        # Transform the answer into binary string
        while sum_ab:
            current_n = sum_ab % 2
            sum_ab = sum_ab // 2
            res = str(current_n) + res
        return res
```


## 68.Text Justification

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/)

- My approach

This is a complex problem, in my idea, there are three key points:

  - 1.How to decide how many words will be in one line?
  - 2.How to deal with the whitespaces?
  - 3.How to deal with the special last line?

Then I set two functions to solve the first and second problem, and a 'if-else' judgement to deal with the third problem.
```python
class Solution:
    def fullJustify(self, words: List[str], maxWidth: int) -> List[str]:
        res = []
        crt_index = 0
        def make_str(pos):
            '''
            Give current position, return a list of current words and next position
            '''
            current_length = len(words[pos])
            for i in range(pos, len(words)):
                if i >= len(words)-1:  # The final line
                    break
                current_length += 1+len(words[i+1])
                if current_length > maxWidth:
                    break
            return words[pos:i+1], i+1
        
        def divide_space(l, n):
            '''
            Give a length and how many parts to divide, return a list of divided result as average as possible
            '''
            if n == 0:  # If only one word
                return [l]
            # For example, 10 divide to 3 parts, they are [4, 3, 3]
            rem = l % n
            new_l = l + n - rem
            space_list = [int(new_l/n)] * n
            for i in range(n-rem):
                space_list[n-i-1] -= 1
            return space_list
        
        while crt_index < len(words):
            word_list, crt_index = make_str(crt_index)
            if crt_index < len(words):
                l_all = 0
                for s in word_list:
                    l_all += len(s)
                l_diff = maxWidth - l_all
                # Distribute whitespaces
                space_list = divide_space(l_diff, len(word_list)-1)
                current_s = word_list[0]
                for i in range(len(space_list)):
                    current_s += ' '*space_list[i]
                    # There may be only one word in word_list
                    try:
                        current_s += word_list[i+1]
                    except:
                        pass
            # The last line is special
            else:
                current_s = ' '.join(word_list)
                num = maxWidth - len(current_s)
                current_s += ' '*num
            res.append(current_s)
        return res
```


## 69.Sqrt(x)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)

- My approach

Using a method like binary search, every time find the middle of current number and last number, until find the number
(n**2 <= x).

```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        n = x // 2
        last_left_n = 0
        last_right_n = n
        while True:
            if n ** 2 > x:
                # Record current n as larger n
                last_right_n = n
                # Next n is half of (current_n + smaller_n)
                n = (n+last_left_n) // 2
            elif n ** 2 < x:
                if (n+1) ** 2 > x:
                    break
                if (n+1) ** 2 == x:
                    n += 1
                    break
                # Record current n as smaller n
                last_left_n = n
                # Next n is half of (current_n + larger_n)
                n = (n+last_right_n) // 2
            elif n ** 2 == x:
                break
        return n
```

And there is a magic method.
```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        a = x
        while a * a > x:
            a = (a + x // a) // 2
        return a
```

The judging condition can be expressed as a mathematical formula `a < sqrt(x) < x/a` or `a > sqrt(x) > x/a`, where `a` is a number 
that smaller than x. And at one certain time, only one of the two formulas can be successful(depends on the value of a).

Explanaion:
```
if a < sqrt(x):
  1/a > 1/sqrt(x)
  x/a > x/sqrt(x)
  x/a > sqrt(x)
so a < sqrt(x) < x/a

if a > sqrt(x):
  1/a < 1/sqrt(x)
  x/a < x/sqrt(x)
  x/a < sqrt(x)
so a > sqrt(x) > x/a
```


## 70.Climbing Stairs

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

- My approach

Firstly I tried recursing method, but time exceeded.

And then I used a mathmatical method.

The idea is calculating every answer from no '2' to the most '2', for example, if the given n is `5`:
```
There can be at most two '2' in the answers, so:

no '2': '11111'
one '2': '2111', '1211', '1121', '1112'
two '2': '221', '212', '122'

The result is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 
```

Here is the code:
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Calculate how many '2' can most be in the answers
        num_of_two = n // 2
        res = 0
        for i in range(1, num_of_two+1):
            # 'positions' means how many positions '2' can be inserted in '1's
            positions = n - 2*i +1
            den = 1
            num = 1
            # Current answer equals to (positions*(posisioins+1)*...*(positions+i-1) / i*(i-1)*...*1)
            # And this is the answer of i '2's in the steps
            for j in range(i):
                den *= (positions+j)
                num *= (i-j)
            res += int(den/num)
        # Finally the result equals to the sum of (one '2', two '2' ... until num_of_two '2') plus no '2', which has only on asnwer
        return res+1
```

- Official approach

There are many official approachs, including recursing, dynamic and fibonacci methods.

The recursing and finonacci methods are a little complex, 
you can see more details from [official solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/solution/).

But I think the dynamic method is smart and easy.
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 2:
            return n
        steps = [0] * n
        steps[0] = 1
        steps[1] = 2
        # Thw ways of current point equals to the sum of i-1 and i-2 point
        for i in range(2, n):
            steps[i] = steps[i-1] + steps[i-2]
        return steps[n-1]
```


## 71.Simplify Path

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/)

- My solution

My idea is transform the string into a list, then delete '.' and '..' by law.
```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        l = path.split('/')
        # Set a memory to store valid path(not '', '.' or '..')
        memory = []
        for i in range(len(l)):
            if l[i] not in ['', '.', '..']:
                memory.append(i)
            # '.' can be passed
            if l[i] == '.':
                l[i] = ''
            # If meet a '..', set '..' and the last element which is not '' to ''
            if l[i] == '..':
                for k in range(len(memory)):
                    if l[memory[len(memory)-k-1]] != '':
                        l[memory[len(memory)-k-1]] = ''
                        break
                l[i] = ''
        j = 1
        # Delete all the '' in l except the first element
        while j < len(l):
            if l[j] == '':
                l.pop(j)
            else:
                j += 1
        res = '/'.join(l)
        if not res:
            return '/'
        return res
```

And there is a more clear method used `stack` with the same idea.
```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        split = path.split("/")
        stack = []
        for item in split:
            # Avoid '' and '.'
            if item and item != '.':
                # When meet a '..', delete the last element in stack
                if item == '..' and stack:
                    stack.pop()
                elif item != '..':
                    stack.append(item)
        return '/' + '/'.join(stack)
```

I should practice to use the classical method like stack.


## 72.Edit Distance  (Dynamic program)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

Firstly I had no idea, so I immediately search other's approaches.

Most of them used `dynamic program`. The main idea is: there are 3 operations(insert, delete, replace), and the number of current step 
equals to the `minimum` of these three opreations.

Here is one of the approaches
```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        mem = {}   # Set a dictionary to store results, it also can be a memory
        def dp(a,b): 
            # If get the start of any of the rowd:
            if a == -1 or b == -1:
                if b > -1:
                    # Means word2 is remained, need to do b+1 inserting
                    return b + 1
                if a > -1:
                    # Means word1 is remained, need to do a+1 deleting
                    return a + 1
                else:
                    return 0
            # Check the memory
            if (a,b) not in mem:
                # case 1: last character is a match
                if word1[a] == word2[b]:
                    mem[(a,b)] = dp(a - 1, b - 1)
                # case 2 3 4: no match. 
                else:
                    # insert
                    c_insert = dp(a, b - 1)
                    # delete
                    c_delete = dp(a - 1, b)
                    # replace
                    c_replace = dp(a - 1, b - 1)
                    cost = 1 + min(c_insert, c_delete, c_replace)
                    mem[(a,b)] = cost
            return mem[(a,b)]
        return dp(len(word1) - 1, len(word2) - 1)
```

And there is also a method without using explicit memory. It uses a decorator `lru_cache` to comply memory. 
[See more details here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/27643991)
```python
from functools import lru_cache

class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            if i >= m:
                return n - j  # insert the rest of word2[j:]
            elif j >= n:
                return m - i  # delete the rest of word1[i:]
            if word1[i] == word2[j]:
                return dp(i + 1, j + 1)
		    # replace, insert, delete, respectively
            return 1 + min(dp(i + 1, j + 1), dp(i, j + 1), dp(i + 1, j))
        
        m, n = map(len, (word1, word2))
        word1, word2 = map(list, (word1, word2))
        return dp(0, 0)
```

### Knowledge

- Decorator `lru_cache` can set a memory to recursing function, so it can save time.
```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache
def traceback():
    # do something
```



## 73.Set Matrix Zero

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/)

- My approach

My idea is firstly traverse the matrix, find all the '0', save the positions into a list.
And then traverse the list, set every rows and columns to zero.
```python
class Solution:
    def setZeroes(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        zeros = []
        visited_row = []
        visited_column = []
        m = len(matrix)
        n = len(matrix[0])
        # Save all the positions into list zeros
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                    zeros.append((i, j))
        for p in zeros:
            # Set the rows to 0, and save current row into memory
            if p[0] not in visited_row:
                matrix[p[0]] = [0] * n
                visited_row.append(p[0])
            # Set the columns to 0, and save current column into memory
            if p[1] not in visited_column:
                for l in range(m):
                    matrix[l][p[1]] = 0
                visited_column.append(p[1])
```

And there is an official with a similar idea, but a little faster.
```python
class Solution:
    def setZeroes(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        m = len(matrix)
        n = len(matrix[0])
        # Save the column and row in two different lists directly
        first_row = [1] * n
        first_column = [1] * m
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                    first_row[j] = 0
                    first_column[i] = 0
        for c in range(m):
            if first_column[c] == 0:
                matrix[c] = [0]*n
        for r in range(n):
            if first_row[r] == 0:
                for l in range(m):
                    matrix[l][r] = 0
```



## 74.Search a 2D Matrix

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)

- My approach

Because it's a sorted matrix, we can compare the target and last element of every row, if target is smaller than the last element, 
the result must be in current row or not exist.

```python
class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        if not matrix or len(matrix[0]) == 0:
            return False
        for m in range(len(matrix)):
            if matrix[m][-1] >= target:
                for i in matrix[m]:
                    if i == target:
                        return True
                return False
        return False
```


## 75.Sort Colors

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

- My approach

By the prompt of the qiestion, I traverse the given list and record the count of '0', '1' and '2'. Then reset 'nums' by them.

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        r = w = b = 0
        # Record the counts
        for i in nums:
            if i == 0:
                r += 1
            if i == 1:
                w += 1
            if i == 2:
                b += 1
        # Reset nums
        for j in range(r):
            nums[j] = 0
        for k in range(r, r+w):
            nums[k] = 1
        for l in range(r+w, r+w+b):
            nums[l] = 2
```

This approach uses a two-pass algorithm, and there is a smart one-pass algorithm.
```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        # Use three pointers
        left, right, cur = 0, len(nums) - 1, 0
        while cur <= right:
            # If meet a '0', change current pointer and the left pointer, and add each of them
            if nums[cur] == 0:
                nums[cur], nums[left] = nums[left], nums[cur]
                cur, left = cur + 1, left + 1
            # If meet a '2', change current pointer and right pointer, and reduce only right pointer
            elif nums[cur] == 2:
                nums[cur], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[cur]
                right = right - 1
            # If meet a '1', just add current pointer
            else:
                cur += 1
```



## 76.Minimun Window Substring !!(Unfinished)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)


## 77.Combinations (Other's approach)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/)

- My approach

My idea is using rescuring method, like finding full combination, but end at 'k' numbers.

```python
class Solution:
    def combine(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums = [i for i in range(1, n+1)]
        self.res = []
        def traceback(sub_l, num):
            if len(sub_l) == k:
                self.res.append(sub_l)
                return
            else:
                for j in range(len(num)):
                    # To avoid duplication, next layer num will start at j+1
                    traceback(sub_l+[num[j]], num[j+1:])
        traceback([], nums)
        return self.res
```

But rescuring always takes a long time, there is a faster approach from others.

- Other's approach

```python
class Solution:
    def combine(self, n: int, k: int):
        nums = list(range(1, k + 1)) + [n + 1]
        ans = []
        idx = 0
        while idx < k:
            ans.append(nums[:k])
            idx = 0
            # When there are neighboring numbers in nums, update nums(ans) in-place
            while idx < k and nums[idx + 1] == nums[idx] + 1:
                nums[idx] = idx + 1
                idx += 1
            nums[idx] += 1
        return ans
```

He found a regular that when there are neighboring numbers in the sun answer `nums`, the last neighboring need to be changed.

- Built-in approach

Python has a built-in method to solve combination problems.

```python
from itertools import combinations

class Solution:
    def combine(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        l = combinations([j for j in range(1,n+1)],k)
        lst = [i for i in l]
        return lst
```

### Knowledgement

Python `combinations` module.

```python
l = combinations(nums, k)
# nums should be a iterable object, k is the length of combination
# and it will return a iterable object
```


## 78.Subsets

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)

- My approach

Firstly I want to use resursing method.

```python
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        self.res = []
        def traceback(sub_n):
            if sub_n not in self.res:
                self.res.append(sub_n)
            for i in range(len(sub_n)):
                traceback(sub_n[:i]+sub_n[i+1:])
        traceback(nums)
        return self.res
```

But it's time limit exceeded.

And then I found a non recursing method, by reducing the numbers one by one.

```python
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        def get_sub(l):
            # Every time get the list after reducing one number
            sub_ans = []
            for sub_l in l:
                for i in range(len(sub_l)):
                    sub_l_after = sub_l[:i] + sub_l[i+1:]
                    if sub_l_after not in sub_ans:
                        sub_ans.append(sub_l_after)
            return sub_ans
        sub_res = [nums]
        res = [[]]
        while len(sub_res[0]) > 0:
            res += sub_res
            sub_res = get_sub(sub_res)
        return res
```

- Other's approach

There is a very easy method.

```python
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res=[[]]
        for num in nums:
            # Every time add current number to the existed answers
            res += [i+[num] for i in res]
            print(res)
        return res
```


## 79.Word Search

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)

- My approach

This is a complex problem. Every single letter has 4 directions, we should consider each direction every time, and if current letter 
is not available, we need to go back to the last letter. So recursing is a good method, because it can record function status.

But my own code didn't work, I tried some ways, but they all failed.
Finally I searched an other's approach.

- Other's approach

This is also a recursing method.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def exist(self, board, word):
        """
        :type board: List[List[str]]
        :type word: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        def recursion(i,j,string,stack):
            '''
            :(i, j): coordinate of letters
            :string: part of given 'word'
            :stack: memory, to save the coordinates which have already been used
            '''
            # Firstly save current coordinate into stack
            stack.append((i,j))
            # If string is '', means there is an available answer
            if not string:
                return True
            # Judge if the left letter is available
            if i-1>=0 and board[i-1][j]==string[0] and (i-1,j) not in stack:
                # The magic is here: finally function recursion will return a bool object, 
                # so the function can directly be used to judge
                if recursion(i-1,j,string[1:],stack):
                    return True
                else:
                    stack.pop()
            # Such as left, judge every directions
            if i+1<len(board) and board[i+1][j]==string[0] and (i+1,j) not in stack:
                if recursion(i+1,j,string[1:],stack):
                    return True
                else:
                    stack.pop()

### Knowledge

In recursing function, if need to traceback, we can try to let the function returns a `bool object`, so that we can 
directly use the function to judge.


## 80.Remove Dplicates From Sorted Array 2

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/)

- My approach

Set a dictionary to count how many times every number appears. When one number appeared moer than two times, remove the remain 
same number.

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        i = 0
        dic = {}
        while i < len(nums):
            if nums[i] not in dic:
                dic[nums[i]] = 1
            else:
                dic[nums[i]] += 1
            if dic[nums[i]] > 2:
                nums.pop(i)
                continue
            i += 1
        return len(nums)
```
