## 321. Create Maximum Number  (Other's approach)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/create-maximum-number/)

- Other's approach

There is a very smart method.

He divided the operation to 2 parts, firstly find i maximum numbers of nums1 and k-i maximum numbers of nums2, then get the maximum combination of them.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxNumber(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        def prep(nums, k):
            '''
            Find k manimum numbers of nums in origin order
            '''
            drop = len(nums) - k
            out = []
            for num in nums:
                while drop and out and out[-1] < num:
                    out.pop()
                    drop -= 1
                out.append(num)
            return out[:k]

        def merge(a, b):
            '''
            The maximum combination of a and b
            '''
            return [max(a, b).pop(0) for _ in a+b]


        res = []
        for i in range(k+1):
            if i <= len(nums1) and k-i <= len(nums2):
                res.append(merge(prep(nums1, i), prep(nums2, k-i)))
        return max(res)
```


## 322. Coin Change  (Greedy-dynamic program)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)

- My pproach

My recursing method was time limit exceeded.

- Official solution

The best way to solve this kind of greedy problem is dynamic program.

dp[x] stands for the minimum coins for x money.

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        
        for coin in coins:
            for x in range(coin, amount + 1):
                dp[x] = min(dp[x], dp[x - coin] + 1)
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1 
```


## 324. Wiggle Sort II

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-sort-ii/)

- My approach

Firstly sort the array then divide the sorted array at the middle. Then add elements from small part and large part alternatelly.

```python
class Solution:
    def wiggleSort(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        nums.sort()
        
        small = nums[:(len(nums)+1)//2]
        large = nums[(len(nums)+1)//2:]

        while nums:
            nums.pop()
        while small:
            nums.append(small.pop())
            if large:
                nums.append(large.pop())
        if large:
            nums.append(large.pop())
```

- Other's approach

An O(1) space complex method.

```python
class Solution:
    def wiggleSort(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        nums.sort() 
        half = len(nums[::2])
        nums[::2], nums[1::2] = nums[:half][::-1], nums[half:][::-1]
```


## 326. Power of Three

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/)

- My approach

Multiply 3 until num is larger or equal to n. Then check if num equals to n.

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfThree(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n == 0:
            return False
        return math.log(n, 3) % 1 == 0
```

Or using `log` to calculate the logarithm of n-3. If n is a power of 3, the logarithm will be an integer.

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfThree(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n <= 0:
            return False
        if n == 1:
            return True
        return math.log10(n) / math.log10(3) % 1 == 0
```

Attention here, using math.log(n, 3) may cause float overflow. For example, the result of math.log(243, 3) is 4.99999.


## 327. Count of Range Sum  (Binary search tree)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-range-sum/)

- My approach

O(n^2) method was time limited exceeded.

- Other's approach

[Here](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-range-sum/discuss/78016/Very-concise-solution-in-Python-with-explanation) is a method from others.

He changes sum(i, j) into `sum(0, j) - sum(0, i)`, and uses binary search tree to sort the sums.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def countRangeSum(self, nums, lower, upper):
        prefix,thisSum,ans = [0],0,0
        # the elemens in prefix stands for sum(0, i) for every i < j, which j is current position
        for n in nums:
            thisSum += n
            # bisect_right and bisect_left return the index to insert thisSum-lower or thisSum-upper into prefix.
            # The different of them is how many available sums in this loop
            # We set x to stand for numbers in prefix, x < thisSum-lower equals to thisSum-x > lower, 
            # thisSum is sum(0, j), x is sum(0, i) so thisSum-x is sum(i, j), so as thisSum-upper
            ans += bisect.bisect_right(prefix, thisSum-lower) - bisect.bisect_left(prefix, thisSum-upper)
            bisect.insort(prefix, thisSum)
        return ans
```


## 328. Odd Even Linked List

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/)

- My approach

Traverse the linked list and every time change the part before current node as an odd even linked list.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        odd = head
        even = head
        while odd.next:
            odd = odd.next  # last odd node until current node
            if not odd.next:
                return head
            next_odd = odd.next.next
            temp = even.next
            
            even.next = odd.next  # last even node until current node
            even = even.next
            even.next = temp
            odd.next = next_odd
        return head
```


## 329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix  ï¼ˆDynamic programming)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/)

- My approach

Recursing method was time limited exceeded.

- Other's approach

Using dynamic program. dp[i][j] stands for the longest increasing path to (i, j) until current traversal.

```python
class Solution:
    def longestIncreasingPath(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:

        def dfs(i, j):
            if not dp[i][j]:
                val = matrix[i][j]
                # 4 directions
                dp[i][j] = 1 + max(
                    dfs(i - 1, j) if i and val > matrix[i - 1][j] else 0,
                    dfs(i + 1, j) if i < M - 1 and val > matrix[i + 1][j] else 0,
                    dfs(i, j - 1) if j and val > matrix[i][j - 1] else 0,
                    dfs(i, j + 1) if j < N - 1 and val > matrix[i][j + 1] else 0)
            return dp[i][j]

        if not matrix or not matrix[0]: return 0
        M, N = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        dp = [[0] * N for i in range(M)]
        return max(dfs(x, y) for x in range(M) for y in range(N))
```


## 330. Patching Array  (Other's approach)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/patching-array/)

- My approach

My idea is using `2^i`,but it failed.

- Other's approach

There is a very smart method. And [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/patching-array/discuss/78488/Solution-%2B-explanation) is the explanation.

The key point is `miss` stands for the maximum sum we can reach. And if nums[i] is out of the range, add nums[i] to miss.

```python
class Solution:
    def minPatches(self, nums: List[int], n: int) -> int:
        patch, miss, i = 0, 1, 0
        while miss <= n:
            if i < len(nums) and nums[i] <= miss:   # loop till miss = max of the covered range + 1 = (K+1)
                                                    # if nums[i] > miss then nums[i] is out of range even after patching miss e.g. 23 in [1,2,4,23,43]
                miss += nums[i]   # get to the max of the covered range + 1, where +1 comes from initializing miss to be 1
                i += 1
            else:
                miss += miss   # patch miss and lift miss from (K+1) to (2K+2) for finding the new (K+1) for the remaining numbers in nums
                patch += 1     # no. of patches + 1
        return patch
```


## 331. Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree  (Other's approach)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/verify-preorder-serialization-of-a-binary-tree/)

- Other's approach

Imagine that every node needs a slot to settle, and when there comes a null node, it will take one slot, when there comes a non-null node, it take one slot and bring two new slots.

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSerialization(self, preorder: str) -> bool:
        p = preorder.split(',')
        
        # initially we have one empty slot to put the root in it
        slot = 1
        for node in p:
            
            # no empty slot to put the current node
            if slot == 0:
                return False
                
            # a null node?
            if node == '#':
                # take one slot
                slot -= 1
            else:
                # take one and bring two
                slot += 1
        
        # at last we don't allow any empty slot
        return slot==0
```


## 332. Reconstruct Itinerary  (DFS method)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/)

- My approach

I wanted to use map firstly.

```python
class Solution:
    def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
        dic = {}
        for t in tickets:
            if t[0] in dic:
                dic[t[0]].append(t[1])
            else:
                dic[t[0]] = [t[1]]
        
        for k in dic:
            dic[k].sort()
            
        start = 'JFK'
        res = ['JFK']
        while start in dic and dic[start]:
            start = dic[start].pop(0)
            res.append(start)
        
        return res
```


But this method may loss some nodes.


- DFS

This problem is betterly solved by DFS method. FIrstly I was confused and thought this was a graph problem, and I was focus on if there is a circle in all the nodes.

But this problem can just fit DFS, if we use a recursing method to traverse all nodes, there will be no nodes lost.

```python
class Solution:
    def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
        dic = {}
        for t in tickets:
            if t[0] in dic:
                dic[t[0]].append(t[1])
            else:
                dic[t[0]] = [t[1]]
        
        for k in dic:
            dic[k].sort()
            
        res = []
        def helper(start):
            while start in dic and dic[start]:
                next_start = dic[start].pop(0)
                helper(next_start)
            res.append(start)
            
        helper('JFK')
        return reversed(res)
```


## 334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence

[Problem link]https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/()

- My approach

Use two pointers to stands for the first number and the second number. When meet a number smaller then them, modify it, until finding the third number.

```python
class Solution:
    def increasingTriplet(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        if not nums:
            return False
        first = nums[0]
        second = float('inf')
        
        for n in nums:
            if n < first:
                first = n
            elif n > first and n < second:
                second = n
            # If find the third number, return true
            elif n > second:
                return True
        return False
```
