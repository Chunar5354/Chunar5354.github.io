## 441. Arranging Coins

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/)

- My approach

Start from sqrt(2n), because we can calculate by `x(x-1)/2 = n`, x is close to and smaller than sqrt(2n).

```python
class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        x = int((2*n)**0.5)
        while x > 0:
            if x*(x+1)//2 <= n:
                return x
            x -= 1
        return x
```

## 442. Find All Duplicates in an Array

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/)

- My approach

Since all the numbers are larger than 1 and smaller than len(nums), we can use the numbers as index. 

For every number n, set nums[n] to negative, and when meet a number that its nums[n] is already negative, means this number has appeared before.

```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        for n in nums:
            n = abs(n)
            if nums[n-1] < 0:
                res.append(n)
            else:
                nums[n-1] *= -1
        return res
```


## 443. String Compression

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/)

- My approach

Add the answers at the tail ot chars, then pop the front elements.

```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        l = len(chars)
        i = 0
        while i < l:
            chars.append(chars[i])
            if i+1 < l and chars[i] == chars[i+1]:
                start = i
                i += 1
                while i < l and chars[i] == chars[start]:
                    i += 1
                length = i - start
                chars += list(str(length))
            else:
                i += 1
        for _ in range(l):
            chars.pop(0)
        return len(chars)
```
