## 81.Search In Rotated Sorted Array 2

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/)

- My approach

The given list is a sortd list, but cut off at a random position. So we can just compare the first and last number with target number. 
And then do the same thing as [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://github.com/Chunar5354/some_notes/blob/master/leetcode/problems/SearchInRotatedSortedArray.md)

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> bool:
        if not nums:
            return False
        # Check the first number
        if target >= nums[0]:
            for i in nums:
                if i == target:
                    return True
        else:
            # Check the last number
            if target <= nums[-1]:
                for j in range(len(nums)):
                    if nums[len(nums)-j-1] < target:
                        return False
                    if nums[len(nums)-j-1] == target:
                        return True
            else:
                return False
        return False
```


## 82.Remove Duplications From Sorted List 2

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list-ii/)

- My approach

The idea is very simple: Traverse the sorted list from start to end, and delete the duplicated nodes.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        res = a = ListNode(0)
        num = head.val
        n = head.next
        # To end the loop, firstly add a flag at the end of given listnode
        while head.next:
            head = head.next
        head.next = ListNode('a')
        while n:
            # At the beginning of the loop, n stands for current node, num stands for the value of last node
            # If there are duplications, go on until next value
            if n.val == num:
                while n.val == num:
                    n = n.next
                num = n.val
                n = n.next
            # If there is no duplication, add ListNode(num) to the end of res
            else:
                a.next = ListNode(num)
                a = a.next
                num = n.val
                n = n.next
        return res.next
```

- Other's approach

There is an in-place method from others. The key idea is using two pointers.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if head is None:
            return 
        
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        # Set two pointers
        prev = dummy
        dummy.next = head
        
        while head and head.next:
            if head.val == head.next.val:
                while head and head.next and head.val == head.next.val:
                    head = head.next
                head = head.next
                prev.next = head
            else:
                prev = prev.next
                head = head.next
        return dummy.next
```


## 83.Remove Duplications From Sorted List

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/)

- My approach

This problem is simplified [Remove Duplications From Sorted List 2](https://github.com/Chunar5354/some_notes/blob/master/leetcode/problems/RemoveDuplicationsFromSortedList2.md)

Just traverse given list and remove duplications in-place.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        n = head
        while n:
            num = n.val
            # If there are duplications, skip them
            while n.next and n.next.val == num:
                n = n.next
            n = n.next
            head.next = n
            head = head.next
        return dummy.next
```


## 84.Largest Rectangle In Histogram (Other's approach)


[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/)

- My approach

This is a hard problem, my approaches were all time exceeded.

- Other's approach

This approach uses a stack to store some ascending parts(like [1, 3, 5, 6] in [2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 2]).
And when the height of current bar is smaller than the last bar in stack, go to calculate the area.

```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = []
        res = 0
        # Firstly add a [0] at the beginning and end
        heights = [0] + heights + [0]
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            # If current height is smaller than the last one in stack, means the start of 'ascending sequence' needs to change
            # and before change it, calculate the area with the bars in stack now.
            while stack and heights[stack[-1]] > heights[i]:
                crt = stack.pop(-1)
                # Because it's ascending order, the largest area of current bar equals to (the height of current bar) * (the distance
                # between current bar and the rightest bar in ascendng order)
                res = max(res, (i-stack[-1]-1)*heights[crt])
            stack.append(i)
        return res
            
```


## 85.Maximal Rectangle

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/)

- My approach

This problem is an extention of [Largest Rectangle In Histogram](https://github.com/Chunar5354/some_notes/blob/master/leetcode/problems/LargestRectangleInHistogram.md).

Firstly convert the matrix into bar chart(x-axis stands for the columns, y-axis stands for height of columns). 
Then use the method of calculating the maximum area of bar chart for each layer.

```python
class Solution:
    def maximalRectangle(self, matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not matrix:
            return 0
        res = 0
        m = len(matrix)
        n = len(matrix[0])
        # Set the x-axis of bar chart
        bar_list = [0] * n
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                # If current position is '1', means the height of current bar should plus 1
                if matrix[i][j] == '1':
                    bar_list[j] += 1
                # If current position is '0', means the bar is cut here, so the height of current bar should be reset to 0
                else:
                    bar_list[j] = 0
            # Calculate the max area of current layer
            res = max(res, self.getArea(bar_list))
        return res
    
    # The same method of 'Largest Rectangle In Histogram'
    def getArea(self, l):
        print(l)
        stack = []
        ans = 0
        l = [0] + l + [0]
        for i in range(len(l)):
            while stack and l[i] < l[stack[-1]]:
                # print(stack, l[i])
                crt_h = stack.pop(-1)
                ans = max(ans, (i-stack[-1]-1)*l[crt_h])
            stack.append(i)
        return ans
```


## 86.Partition List

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/)

- My approach

Create two linked lists to store the less nodes and larger nodes, then link the large list at the end of less list.

```pyhon
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: ListNode, x: int) -> ListNode:
        # Create two linked lists
        less_head = le = ListNode(0)
        large_head = la = ListNode(0)
        n = head
        while n:
            if n.val < x:
                le.next = n
                le = le.next
            else:
                la.next = n
                la = la.next
            n = n.next
        la.next = None
        # Link the large list at the end of less list
        le.next = large_head.next
        return less_head.next
```


## 87.Scramble String  (DFS method)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/scramble-string/)

This problem is a little difficult so I didn't solve it.

- Other's approach

I searched for other's approach, and there is a good solution by using `DFS` (depth first search) method.

```python
class Solution:
    def isScramble(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        '''
        作为一个递归函数，它将返回一个bool值
        每次传入的s1和s2视为上一层字符串的一个分支
        '''
        if not s1 or not s2 or len(s1) != len(s2):
            return False
        # 如果s1和s2中的字母不相同的话，那么当前的两个分支肯定不能相等
        if sorted(s1) != sorted(s2):
            return False
        if s1 == s2:
            return True  
        for i in range(1, len(s1)):
            # 要满足的条件为：s1的前i项和s2的前i项相等并且s1的后i项和s2的后i项相等
            # 或者s1的前i项和s2的后i项相等并且s1的后i项和s2的前i项相等
            if (self.isScramble(s1[:i], s2[:i]) and self.isScramble(1[i:], s2[i:])) \
                or (self.isScramble(s1[:i], s2[-i:]) and self.isScramble(s1[i:], s2[:-i])):
                return True
        
        return False
```


## 88.Merge Sorted Array

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

- My approach

Just compare the elements in nums1 and nums2, and add nums2 into nums1. But pay attention to the limit of length.

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
        """
        i = 0
        for j in range(n):
            # Skip the elements which are smaller than current nums2[j]
            while nums1[i] <= nums2[j] and i < m+j:
                i += 1
            # Firstly move the next (m+j-i) elements of current nums1[i], then add nums2[j] into nums1[i]
            for k in range(m+j-i):
                nums1[m+j-k] = nums1[m+j-k-1]
            nums1[i] = nums2[j]
```

This method is not very clearly, I found an other's method which is more clearly.

- Other's approach

This approach adds the elements from right to left, so it can avoid the moving operations.

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
        """
        while m > 0 and n > 0:
            # We only need to deal with the first m elements in nums1, and first n elements in nums2
            if nums1[m-1] >= nums2[n-1]:
                nums1[m+n-1] = nums1[m-1]
                m -= 1
            else:
                nums1[m+n-1] = nums2[n-1]
                n -= 1
        if n > 0:
            nums1[:n] = nums2[:n]
```


## 89.Gray Code



[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/gray-code/)

- My approach

`Two number differ in only one bit` means XOR（异或） these two numbers, and the answer will only have one '1' in all the bits.

```python
class Solution:
    def grayCode(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        res = [0]
        for _ in range(2**n):
            for j in range(n):
                # XOR the last number in res and current 2**j
                # becaues 2**j has only one '1' bit
                num = abs(res[-1]^(2**j))
                if num not in res:
                    res.append(num)
                    break
        return res
```

And there is a very smart method from others.

- Other's approach

```python
class Solution:
    def grayCode(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        for i in range(2 ** n):
            res.append(i ^ (i >> 1))    # I want to know why?
        return res
```

I think it's a mathematical magic.

### Knowledge

In Python, XOR operation is `a ^ b`


## 90.Subsets 2

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/)

- My approach

This is an extension of [Subsets](https://github.com/Chunar5354/some_notes/blob/master/leetcode/problems/Subsets.md).

We can improve the approach os Subsets.

```python
class Solution:
    def subsetsWithDup(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        res=[[]]
        for n in range(len(nums)):
            # Every time add current number to the existed answers
            # Add a judge
            res += [i+[nums[n]] for i in res if i+[nums[n]] not in res]
        return res
```

Because there need to judge if current answer has already in the final result list, this mtehod runs slower.

- Other's approach

This problem can also be solved by recursing method(or DFS).

```python
class Solution:
    def subsetsWithDup(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        nums.sort()

        def dfs(curr, idx):
            '''
            :curr: sub list
            :inx: the index of current position
            '''
            res.append(list(curr))
            # If current position is the last one, this branch should be finished
            if idx == len(nums):
                return
            
            prev = None
            # Only need to deal with the elements after current position
            for i in range(idx, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] == prev:
                    continue
                curr.append(nums[i])
                dfs(curr, i+1)
                # This is the key operation, after call the next layer function, pop the last element in curr as a judge
                # So we can keep all the 'curr' in one function layer have the same length
                prev = curr.pop()
                
        dfs([], 0)
        return res
```


## 91.Decode Ways (A Difficult Incomprehensible Method)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/)

- My approach

My recursing method was time exceeded again. It's important to use memory in recursing funciton.

- Other's approach

The best way to solve this problem is calculating ways of current number, which equals to (use one number to represend a letter) plus 
(use two numbers to represend a letter(only the number is smaller than 26)).

And it can be recursing and just traverse.

```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memo={}
        
    def numDecodings(self, s: str) -> int:
        if not s:
            return 0
        return self.recursive_with_memo(0, s)
    
    def recursive_with_memo(self, index, s) -> int:
        if index == len(s):
            return 1
        if s[index] == '0':
            return 0
        if index == len(s)-1:
            return 1
        if index in self.memo:
            return self.memo[index]
        # The ways of current number
        ans = self.recursive_with_memo(index+1,s) +\
            (self.recursive_with_memo(index+2,s) if (int(s[index:index+2])<=26) else 0)
        # Save it into memory
        self.memo[index]=ans
        
        return ans
```

And the un-recursing one is a little difficult to understand.

```python
class Solution:
    def numDecodings(self, s: str) -> int:
        if s[0] == '0': return 0
        prev = 1
        last = 1
        cur = last
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == '0':
                if s[i-1] == '0' or int(s[i-1:i+1]) >26: return 0
                cur = prev
            elif s[i-1] == '0' or int(s[i-1:i+1]) > 26:
                cur = last
            else:
                cur = prev + last
            prev = last
            last = cur
        return cur        
```


## 92.Reverse Linked List 2

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/)

- My solution

Find the edge of the nodes need to reverse, and reverse them one by one.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: ListNode, m: int, n: int) -> ListNode:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        end = dummy
        i = 0
        # The right edge gies first
        while i < n-m:
            end = end.next
            i += 1
        start = dummy
        # After right edge goes (n-m) steps, left edge start to go
        i = 0
        while i < m-1:
            start = start.next
            end = end.next
            i += 1
        # Now the target nodes are from start.next to end.next
        final = end.next.next
        judge = start.next
        # Reverse them one by one
        # For example: 2345 -> 3245 -> 4325 -> 5432
        while judge.next != final:
            curr = judge.next
            judge.next = curr.next
            curr.next = start.next
            start.next = curr
        return dummy.next
```

- Other's approach

The approach above can be improved, because we needn't to find the right edge.

There is a simplified approach from someone else.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: ListNode, m: int, n: int) -> ListNode:
        if not head or m == n: return head
        
        pre = dummy = ListNode(-1)
        dummy.next = head
        
        for i in range(m - 1):
            pre = pre.next
        tail = pre.next
        # Only need to find the left edge, and do reverse (n-m) times
        for i in range(n - m):
            temp = pre.next
            pre.next = tail.next
            tail.next = tail.next.next
            pre.next.next = temp
        
        return dummy.next
```

- Official approach

Official solution provides a recursing method. Find the two edges and swap them everytime. The key idea is use function return 
to the last layer to simulate a backward pointer.

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head, m, n):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """

        if not head:
            return None

        left, right = head, head
        stop = False
        def recurseAndReverse(right, m, n):
            nonlocal left, stop
            # print(left, '\n', right)

            # base case. Don't proceed any further
            if n == 1:
                return

            # Keep moving the right pointer one step forward until (n == 1)
            right = right.next

            # Keep moving left pointer to the right until we reach the proper node
            # from where the reversal is to start.
            if m > 1:
                left = left.next

            # Recurse with m and n reduced.
            recurseAndReverse(right, m - 1, n - 1)

            # In case both the pointers cross each other or become equal, we
            # stop i.e. don't swap data any further. We are done reversing at this
            # point.
            
            # print('after call:', left, '\n', right)
            if left == right or right.next == left:
                stop = True

            # Until the boolean stop is false, swap data between the two pointers     
            if not stop:
                left.val, right.val = right.val, left.val

                # Move left one step to the right.
                # The right pointer moves one step back via backtracking.
                left = left.next           

        recurseAndReverse(right, m, n)
        return head
```


## 93.Restore IP Addresses

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-ip-addresses/)

- My approach

Recursing method.

```python
class Solution:
    def restoreIpAddresses(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        self.res = []
        def traceback(prev, i, num):
            '''
            :prev: finished part of one IP address
            :i: current index of s
            :num: the number of '.' in prev
            '''
            if i >= len(s):
                if num == 4:
                    # Remove the last '.' in prev
                    self.res += [prev[:-1]]
                return
            if num == 4 and i < len(s):
                return
            if s[i] == '0':
                # There can't be any other number after '0' in one field
                traceback(prev+s[i:i+1]+'.', i+1, num+1)
                return
            j = 1
            while i+j <= len(s) and int(s[i:i+j]) <= 255:
                traceback(prev+s[i:i+j]+'.', i+j, num+1)
                j += 1
        traceback('', 0, 0)
        return self.res             
```


## 94.Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)

- My solution

Inorder traverse of binary tree(中序遍历), means for every node in binary tree, visit it as the order left child, self, right node.

We can use recursing method.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        self.res = []
        def traceback(n):
            if not n:
                return
            # If current node doesn't have left child, add current value into result, and traverse its right child
            if not n.left:
                self.res += [n.val]
                traceback(n.right)
            # The order: left child, self, right child
            else:
                traceback(n.left)
                self.res += [n.val]
                traceback(n.right)
                
        traceback(root)
        return self.res
```

And we can also use stack.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        stack = []
        n = root
        while n or stack:
            # Go left until there is no left child
            while n:
                stack.append(n)
                n = n.left
            n = stack.pop()
            res.append(n.val)
            n = n.right
        return res
```


## 95.Unique Binary Search Trees 2 (BST)


[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees-ii/)

I was confused that BST(二叉搜索树) and BFS(广度优先搜索), so I did'nt understand this question firstly.

- Other's approach

The feature of BST is 'All the left children are smaller than current node, and all the right children are larger than current node'.

So we can do it by recursing method.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def generateTrees(self, n: int) -> List[TreeNode]:
        def genSubTree(elements: list):
            '''
            This function returns a list which can be all the available child tree of BTS,
            if it contains root, current res is the final result
            '''
            if len(elements) == 0:
                return [None]
            if len(elements) == 1:
                return [TreeNode(elements[0])]
            res = []
            for i in range(len(elements)):
                # The number smaller than current i is left child
                left = genSubTree(elements[:i])
                # The number larger than current i is right child
                right = genSubTree(elements[i+1:])
                for l in left:
                    for r in right:
                        root = TreeNode(elements[i])
                        root.left = l
                        root.right = r
                        res.append(root)
            return res
        
        if n == 0:
            return []
        return genSubTree(list(range(1, n+1)))
            
```

- Knowledge

BTS: Binary Search Tree, all the left children are smaller than current node, all the right children are larger than current node.



## 96.Unique Binary Search Trees (BST Regular Pattern)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/)

- My approach

Firstly I want use the method like [Unique Binary Search Trees 2](https://github.com/Chunar5354/some_notes/blob/master/leetcode/problems/UniqueBinarySearchTrees2.md), 
(I don't understand why Unique Binary Search Trees 2 is 95 and 
Unique Binary Search Trees is 96), but it's time exceeded.

And after searching other's approach, I found there is a regular pattern of BST.

- Other's approach

```python
class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:
        
        memo = collections.defaultdict(int)
        
        memo[0] = 1
        memo[1] = 1
        memo[2] = 2
        
        for i in range(3, n+1):
            for j in range(i):
                # Current number equals to the sum of the product of two numbers which sum equals to (n-1)
                memo[i] += memo[j]*memo[i-j-1]
        return memo[n]
```


## 97.Interleaving String

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/)

- My approach

Use recursing method, check if the first letter in s3 equals to thhe first letter in s1 or s2, and do the same for their slices.

And by the prompt of official solution, use memory and set a tuple of three indexs(s1.index, s2.indx, s3.index) as key.

```python
class Solution:
    def isInterleave(self, s1: str, s2: str, s3: str) -> bool:
        self.mem = {}
        def traceback(a, b, c):
            if c == len(s3):
                return True
            if a == len(s1):
                return s2[b:] == s3[c:]
            if b == len(s2):
                return s1[a:] == s3[c:]
            # Use a memory
            if (a, b, c) in self.mem:
                return self.mem[(a, b, c)]
            # There can be 4 situations:
            # 1.Neither s1 nor s2 is matched
            if s1[a] != s3[c] and s2[b] != s3[c]:
                return False
            # 2.Both s1 and s2 are matched
            elif s1[a] == s3[c] and s2[b] == s3[c]:
                self.mem[(a, b, c)] = (traceback(a+1, b, c+1) or traceback(a, b+1, c+1))
                return self.mem[(a, b, c)]
            # 3.s1 is matched and s2 is not
            elif s1[a] == s3[c] and s2[b] != s3[c]:
                self.mem[(a, b, c)] = traceback(a+1, b, c+1)
                return self.mem[(a, b, c)]
            # 4.s2 is matched and s1 is not
            elif s1[a] != s3[c] and s2[b] == s3[c]:
                self.mem[(a, b, c)] = traceback(a, b+1, c+1)
                return self.mem[(a, b, c)]
        if len(s1) + len(s2) != len(s3):
            return False
        return traceback(0, 0, 0)
```

And there is also a dynamic program method.

For more imformation of dp method, you can read the official solution.

```python
class Solution:
    def isInterleave(self, s1: str, s2: str, s3: str) -> bool:
        if len(s1) + len(s2) != len(s3):
            return False
        if not s1:
            return s2 == s3
        if not s2:
            return s1 == s3
        m = len(s1) + 1
        n = len(s2) + 1
        # dp is a two-dimensional array, and dp[m-1][n-1] will be the final answer
        dp = [[False for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
        dp[0][0] = True
        for i in range(1, n):
            if dp[0][i-1] and s2[i-1] == s3[i-1]:
                dp[0][i] = True
        # If the left or above element is True, means current index of s3(i+j-1) can be reached, and at this situation if
        # current letter of s1(s1[i-1]) or s2(s2[j-1]) equals to s3[i+j-1], means current letter in s3 is available, set it to True.
        # Pay attention theat one letter can only be used once, so s1[i-1] should be paired with the above element(dp[i-1][j]),
        # and s2[j-1] should be paired with the left element(dp[i][j-1])
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(len(dp[0])):
                if (dp[i][j-1] and s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1]) or (dp[i-1][j] and s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1]):
                    dp[i][j] = True
        return dp[m-1][n-1]
```


## 98.Validate Binary Search Tree

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)

- My approach

Binary Search Tree has a property that its inorder traverse is ascending.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        stack = []
        n_list = []
        n = root
        # Inorder traverse the binary tree 
        while stack or n:
            if n:
                stack.append(n)
            while n and n.left:        
                n = n.left
                stack.append(n)
            crt_n = stack.pop()
            n_list.append(crt_n.val)
            n = crt_n.right
        # Check if the list is in ascending order
        for i in range(1, len(n_list)):
            if n_list[i] <= n_list[i-1]:
                return False
        return True
```

And this method can be simplified.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        stack = []
        num = float('-inf')
        n = root
        while stack or n:
            while n:        
                stack.append(n)
                n = n.left
            crt_n = stack.pop()
            # Don't need to return a value list, just check during the traverse
            if crt_n.val <= num:
                return False
            num = crt_n.val
            n = crt_n.right
        return True
```

And this problem can also be solved by recursing method. Please see it at official solution.


## 99.Recover Binary Search Tree (Other's approach)

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-binary-search-tree/)

- My approach

Firstlt I focus om how to change the two nodes, so I was confused and then searched for others' approach.

After seeing other's method, I realized that there is no need to change the two nodex, we just need to change the value of two nodes.

And there is a very smart method.

- Other's approach

He do an inorder traverse for the given binary tree. Save the nodes and values by order. And because the inorder traverse of a 
binary search tree is ascending, he sorts the value list, then recover the nodes.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def recoverTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
        """
        nodes = []
        values = []
        self.inorder(root, nodes, values)
        # Sort the value list, and recover the binary tree
        values.sort()
        for i in range(len(nodes)):
            nodes[i].val = values[i]
        
    def inorder(self, root, nodes, values):
        '''
        inorder traverse the given tree, and save the value and nodes
        '''
        if root:
            self.inorder(root.left, nodes, values)
            nodes.append(root)
            values.append(root.val)
            self.inorder(root.right, nodes, values)
```

There is a method that don't need to recover all the nodes, just need to exchange the value of two wrong nodes.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def recoverTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
        """
        first = None
        second = None
        
        stack = []
        node = root
        previous = TreeNode(float('-inf'))
        # Do an inorder traverse
        while node or stack:
            while node:
                stack.append(node)
                node = node.left
            node = stack.pop()
            # Inorder traverse of a binary sarch tree should be ascending
            # If current value is smaller than the previous one, previous node should be the wrong node
            # Then we just need to find the next wrong node, and exchange their values
            if previous.val > node.val:
                second = node
                if first is None:
                    first = previous
                else:
                    break
            previous = node
            node = node.right
        
        first.val, second.val = second.val, first.val
```


## 100.Same Tree

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)

- My approach

Traverse two trees and check if the two traverse list are the same.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.

#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if not p:
            return not q
        if not q:

            if n:
                if n.left:
                    n_list.append(n.left.val)
                else:
                    n_list.append(None)
                if n.right:
                    n_list.append(n.right.val)
                else:
                    n_list.append(None)
                traverse(n.left)
                traverse(n.right)
        traverse(p)
        p_list = n_list
        n_list = [q.val]
        traverse(q)
        return p_list == n_list
```

And there is a more easily method.

- Official approach

```python
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p, q):
        """
        :type p: TreeNode
        :type q: TreeNode
        :rtype: bool
        """    
        # p and q are both None
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        # one of p and q is None
        if not q or not p:
            return False
        if p.val != q.val:
            return False
        return self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right) and \
               self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left)
```
